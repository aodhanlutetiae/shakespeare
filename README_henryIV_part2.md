README for Henry IV, part 2

This file was created as a supplement to the Kaggle dataset of 'Shakespeare's plays' : https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays/home because it does not include Henry IV, part 2.

It was scraped from the MIT Shakespeare text page http://shakespeare.mit.edu/2henryiv/full.html
using BeautifulSoup, then cleaned in a google spreadsheet and in pandas.

NOTE : This dataset of Henry IV, part 2 does NOT include stage directions, only spoken lines.
NOTE : This dataset of Henry IV, part 2 does NOT include PlayerLinenumber data that is found in the 36-play dataset. It does include an empty PlayerLinenumber column to facilitate joins with the original dataset.
