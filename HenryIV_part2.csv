43,44,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.3,Porter,What shall I say you are?
44,45,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.4,LORD BARDOLPH,Tell thou the earl
45,46,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.5,LORD BARDOLPH,That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
46,47,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.6,Porter,His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard;
47,48,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.7,Porter,"Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,"
48,49,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.8,Porter,And he himself wilt answer.
49,50,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.9,LORD BARDOLPH,Here comes the earl.
50,51,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.10,NORTHUMBERLAND,"What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now"
51,52,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.11,NORTHUMBERLAND,Should be the father of some stratagem:
52,53,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.12,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The times are wild: contention, like a horse"
53,54,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.13,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose"
54,55,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.14,NORTHUMBERLAND,And bears down all before him.
55,56,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.15,LORD BARDOLPH,"Noble earl,"
56,57,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.16,LORD BARDOLPH,I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.
57,58,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.17,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Good, an God will!"
58,59,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.18,LORD BARDOLPH,As good as heart can wish:
59,60,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.19,LORD BARDOLPH,The king is almost wounded to the death;
60,61,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.20,LORD BARDOLPH,"And, in the fortune of my lord your son,"
61,62,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.21,LORD BARDOLPH,Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
62,63,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.22,LORD BARDOLPH,Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John
63,64,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.23,LORD BARDOLPH,And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;
64,65,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.24,LORD BARDOLPH,"And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,"
65,66,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.25,LORD BARDOLPH,"Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,"
66,67,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.26,LORD BARDOLPH,"So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,"
67,68,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.27,LORD BARDOLPH,"Came not till now to dignify the times,"
68,69,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.28,LORD BARDOLPH,Since Caesar's fortunes!
69,70,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.29,NORTHUMBERLAND,How is this derived?
70,71,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.30,NORTHUMBERLAND,Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?
71,72,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.31,LORD BARDOLPH,"I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,"
72,73,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.32,LORD BARDOLPH,"A gentleman well bred and of good name,"
73,74,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.33,LORD BARDOLPH,That freely render'd me these news for true.
74,75,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.34,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent"
75,76,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.35,NORTHUMBERLAND,On Tuesday last to listen after news.
76,77,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.36,LORD BARDOLPH,"My lord, I over-rode him on the way;"
77,78,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.37,LORD BARDOLPH,And he is furnish'd with no certainties
78,79,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.38,LORD BARDOLPH,More than he haply may retail from me.
79,80,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.39,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?"
80,81,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.40,TRAVERS,"My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back"
81,82,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.41,TRAVERS,"With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,"
82,83,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.42,TRAVERS,Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
83,84,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.43,TRAVERS,"A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,"
84,85,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.44,TRAVERS,That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
85,86,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.45,TRAVERS,He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him
86,87,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.46,TRAVERS,I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:
87,88,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.47,TRAVERS,He told me that rebellion had bad luck
88,89,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.48,TRAVERS,And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
89,90,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.49,TRAVERS,"With that, he gave his able horse the head,"
90,91,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.50,TRAVERS,And bending forward struck his armed heels
91,92,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.51,TRAVERS,Against the panting sides of his poor jade
92,93,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.52,TRAVERS,"Up to the rowel-head, and starting so"
93,94,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.53,TRAVERS,"He seem'd in running to devour the way,"
94,95,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.54,TRAVERS,Staying no longer question.
95,96,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.55,NORTHUMBERLAND,Ha! Again:
96,97,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.56,NORTHUMBERLAND,Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
97,98,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.57,NORTHUMBERLAND,Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion
98,99,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.58,NORTHUMBERLAND,Had met ill luck?
99,100,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.59,LORD BARDOLPH,"My lord, I'll tell you what;"
100,101,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.60,LORD BARDOLPH,"If my young lord your son have not the day,"
101,102,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.61,LORD BARDOLPH,"Upon mine honour, for a silken point"
102,103,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.62,LORD BARDOLPH,I'll give my barony: never talk of it.
103,104,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.63,NORTHUMBERLAND,Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
104,105,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.64,NORTHUMBERLAND,Give then such instances of loss?
105,106,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.65,LORD BARDOLPH,"Who, he?"
106,107,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.66,LORD BARDOLPH,He was some hilding fellow that had stolen
107,108,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.67,LORD BARDOLPH,"The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,"
108,109,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.68,LORD BARDOLPH,"Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news."
109,110,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.69,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,"
110,111,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.70,NORTHUMBERLAND,Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:
111,112,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.71,NORTHUMBERLAND,So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
112,113,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.72,NORTHUMBERLAND,Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
113,114,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.73,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?"
114,115,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.74,MORTON,"I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;"
115,116,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.75,MORTON,Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
116,117,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.76,MORTON,To fright our party.
117,118,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.77,NORTHUMBERLAND,How doth my son and brother?
118,119,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.78,NORTHUMBERLAND,Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
119,120,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.79,NORTHUMBERLAND,Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
120,121,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.80,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,"
121,122,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.81,NORTHUMBERLAND,"So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,"
122,123,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.82,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,"
123,124,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.83,NORTHUMBERLAND,And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
124,125,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.84,NORTHUMBERLAND,"But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,"
125,126,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.85,NORTHUMBERLAND,And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
126,127,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.86,NORTHUMBERLAND,"This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;"
127,128,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.87,NORTHUMBERLAND,Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'
128,129,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.88,NORTHUMBERLAND,Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:
129,130,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.89,NORTHUMBERLAND,"But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,"
130,131,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.90,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,"
131,132,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.91,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'"
132,133,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.92,MORTON,"Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;"
133,134,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.93,MORTON,"But, for my lord your son--"
134,135,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.94,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Why, he is dead."
135,136,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.95,NORTHUMBERLAND,See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
136,137,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.96,NORTHUMBERLAND,He that but fears the thing he would not know
137,138,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.97,NORTHUMBERLAND,Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
138,139,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.98,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;"
139,140,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.99,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Tell thou an earl his divination lies,"
140,141,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.100,NORTHUMBERLAND,And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
141,142,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.101,NORTHUMBERLAND,And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
142,143,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.102,MORTON,You are too great to be by me gainsaid:
143,144,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.103,MORTON,"Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain."
144,145,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.104,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead."
145,146,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.105,NORTHUMBERLAND,I see a strange confession in thine eye:
146,147,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.106,NORTHUMBERLAND,Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
147,148,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.107,NORTHUMBERLAND,"To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;"
148,149,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.108,NORTHUMBERLAND,The tongue offends not that reports his death:
149,150,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.109,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,"
150,151,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.110,NORTHUMBERLAND,Not he which says the dead is not alive.
151,152,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.111,NORTHUMBERLAND,Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
152,153,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.112,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Hath but a losing office, and his tongue"
153,154,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.113,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,"
154,155,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.114,NORTHUMBERLAND,Remember'd tolling a departing friend.
155,156,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.115,LORD BARDOLPH,"I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead."
156,157,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.116,MORTON,I am sorry I should force you to believe
157,158,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.117,MORTON,That which I would to God I had not seen;
158,159,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.118,MORTON,"But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,"
159,160,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.119,MORTON,"Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,"
160,161,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.120,MORTON,To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down
161,162,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.121,MORTON,"The never-daunted Percy to the earth,"
162,163,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.122,MORTON,From whence with life he never more sprung up.
163,164,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.123,MORTON,"In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire"
164,165,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.124,MORTON,"Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,"
165,166,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.125,MORTON,"Being bruited once, took fire and heat away"
166,167,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.126,MORTON,From the best temper'd courage in his troops;
167,168,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.127,MORTON,For from his metal was his party steel'd;
168,169,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.128,MORTON,"Which once in him abated, all the rest"
169,170,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.129,MORTON,"Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:"
170,171,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.130,MORTON,"And as the thing that's heavy in itself,"
171,172,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.131,MORTON,"Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,"
172,173,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.132,MORTON,"So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,"
173,174,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.133,MORTON,Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
174,175,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.134,MORTON,That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
175,176,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.135,MORTON,"Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,"
176,177,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.136,MORTON,Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester
177,178,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.137,MORTON,"Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,"
178,179,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.138,MORTON,"The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword"
179,180,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.139,MORTON,"Had three times slain the appearance of the king,"
180,181,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.140,MORTON,Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
181,182,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.141,MORTON,"Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,"
182,183,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.142,MORTON,"Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all"
183,184,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.143,MORTON,"Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out"
184,185,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.144,MORTON,"A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,"
185,186,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.145,MORTON,Under the conduct of young Lancaster
186,187,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.146,MORTON,And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
187,188,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.147,NORTHUMBERLAND,For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
188,189,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.148,NORTHUMBERLAND,"In poison there is physic; and these news,"
189,190,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.149,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Having been well, that would have made me sick,"
190,191,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.150,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Being sick, have in some measure made me well:"
191,192,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.151,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,"
192,193,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.152,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,"
193,194,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.153,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire"
194,195,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.154,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,"
195,196,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.155,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,"
196,197,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.156,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!"
197,198,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.157,NORTHUMBERLAND,A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
198,199,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.158,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!"
199,200,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.159,NORTHUMBERLAND,Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
200,201,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.160,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit."
201,202,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.161,NORTHUMBERLAND,Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
202,203,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.162,NORTHUMBERLAND,The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
203,204,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.163,NORTHUMBERLAND,To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!
204,205,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.164,NORTHUMBERLAND,Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand
205,206,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.165,NORTHUMBERLAND,Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!
206,207,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.166,NORTHUMBERLAND,And let this world no longer be a stage
207,208,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.167,NORTHUMBERLAND,To feed contention in a lingering act;
208,209,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.168,NORTHUMBERLAND,But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
209,210,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.169,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set"
210,211,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.170,NORTHUMBERLAND,"On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,"
211,212,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.171,NORTHUMBERLAND,And darkness be the burier of the dead!
212,213,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.172,TRAVERS,"This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord."
213,214,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.173,LORD BARDOLPH,"Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour."
214,215,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.174,MORTON,The lives of all your loving complices
215,216,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.175,MORTON,"Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er"
216,217,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.176,MORTON,"To stormy passion, must perforce decay."
217,218,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.177,MORTON,"You cast the event of war, my noble lord,"
218,219,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.178,MORTON,"And summ'd the account of chance, before you said"
219,220,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.179,MORTON,"Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,"
220,221,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.180,MORTON,"That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:"
221,222,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.181,MORTON,"You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,"
222,223,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.182,MORTON,More likely to fall in than to get o'er;
223,224,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.183,MORTON,You were advised his flesh was capable
224,225,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.184,MORTON,Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
225,226,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.185,MORTON,Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:
226,227,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.186,MORTON,"Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,"
227,228,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.187,MORTON,"Though strongly apprehended, could restrain"
228,229,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.188,MORTON,"The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,"
229,230,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.189,MORTON,"Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,"
230,231,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.190,MORTON,More than that being which was like to be?
231,232,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.191,LORD BARDOLPH,We all that are engaged to this loss
232,233,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.192,LORD BARDOLPH,Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
233,234,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.193,LORD BARDOLPH,That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;
234,235,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.194,LORD BARDOLPH,"And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed"
235,236,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.195,LORD BARDOLPH,Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;
236,237,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.196,LORD BARDOLPH,"And since we are o'erset, venture again."
237,238,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.197,LORD BARDOLPH,"Come, we will all put forth, body and goods."
238,239,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.198,MORTON,"Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,"
239,240,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.199,MORTON,"I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,"
240,241,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.200,MORTON,The gentle Archbishop of York is up
241,242,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.201,MORTON,With well-appointed powers: he is a man
242,243,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.202,MORTON,Who with a double surety binds his followers.
243,244,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.203,MORTON,"My lord your son had only but the corpse,"
244,245,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.204,MORTON,"But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;"
245,246,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.205,MORTON,"For that same word, rebellion, did divide"
246,247,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.206,MORTON,The action of their bodies from their souls;
247,248,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.207,MORTON,"And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,"
248,249,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.208,MORTON,"As men drink potions, that their weapons only"
249,250,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.209,MORTON,"Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,"
250,251,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.210,MORTON,"This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,"
251,252,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.211,MORTON,As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop
252,253,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.212,MORTON,Turns insurrection to religion:
253,254,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.213,MORTON,"Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,"
254,255,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.214,MORTON,He's followed both with body and with mind;
255,256,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.215,MORTON,And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
256,257,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.216,MORTON,"Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;"
257,258,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.217,MORTON,Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;
258,259,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.218,MORTON,"Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,"
259,260,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.219,MORTON,Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;
260,261,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.220,MORTON,And more and less do flock to follow him.
261,262,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.221,NORTHUMBERLAND,"I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,"
262,263,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.222,NORTHUMBERLAND,This present grief had wiped it from my mind.
263,264,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.223,NORTHUMBERLAND,Go in with me; and counsel every man
264,265,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.224,NORTHUMBERLAND,The aptest way for safety and revenge:
265,266,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.225,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:"
266,267,"Henry IV, part two",,1.1.226,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Never so few, and never yet more need."
267,268,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.1,FALSTAFF,"Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?"
268,269,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.2,Page,"He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy"
269,270,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.3,Page,"water; but, for the party that owed it, he might"
270,271,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.4,Page,have more diseases than he knew for.
271,272,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.5,FALSTAFF,Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the
272,273,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.6,FALSTAFF,"brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not"
273,274,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.7,FALSTAFF,"ble to invent anything that tends to laughter, more"
274,275,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.8,FALSTAFF,than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only
275,276,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.9,FALSTAFF,"witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other"
276,277,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.10,FALSTAFF,men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that
277,278,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.11,FALSTAFF,hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the
278,279,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.12,FALSTAFF,prince put thee into my service for any other reason
279,280,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.13,FALSTAFF,"than to set me off, why then I have no judgment."
280,281,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.14,FALSTAFF,"Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn"
281,282,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.15,FALSTAFF,in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never
282,283,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.16,FALSTAFF,manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you
283,284,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.17,FALSTAFF,"neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and"
284,285,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.18,FALSTAFF,"send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--"
285,286,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.19,FALSTAFF,"the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is"
286,287,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.20,FALSTAFF,not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in
287,288,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.21,FALSTAFF,the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his
288,289,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.22,FALSTAFF,cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is
289,290,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.23,FALSTAFF," face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis"
290,291,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.24,FALSTAFF,not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at 
291,292,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.25,FALSTAFF,"face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence"
292,293,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.26,FALSTAFF,out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had
293,294,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.27,FALSTAFF,writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He
294,295,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.28,FALSTAFF,"may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,"
295,296,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.29,FALSTAFF,I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about
296,297,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.30,FALSTAFF,the satin for my short cloak and my slops?
297,298,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.31,Page,"He said, sir, you should procure him better"
298,299,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.32,Page,ssurance than Bardolph: he would not take his
299,300,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.33,Page,band and yours; he liked not the security.
300,301,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.34,FALSTAFF,"Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his"
301,302,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.35,FALSTAFF,tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally
302,303,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.36,FALSTAFF,"yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,"
303,304,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.37,FALSTAFF,nd then stand upon security! The whoreson
304,305,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.38,FALSTAFF,"smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and"
305,306,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.39,FALSTAFF,bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is
306,307,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.40,FALSTAFF,"through with them in honest taking up, then they"
307,308,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.41,FALSTAFF,must stand upon security. I had as lief they would
308,309,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.42,FALSTAFF,put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with
309,310,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.43,FALSTAFF,security. I looked a' should have sent me two and
310,311,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.44,FALSTAFF,"twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he"
311,312,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.45,FALSTAFF,"sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;"
312,313,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.46,FALSTAFF,"for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness"
313,314,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.47,FALSTAFF,of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he
314,315,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.48,FALSTAFF,"see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him."
315,316,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.49,FALSTAFF,Where's Bardolph?
316,317,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.50,Page,He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.
317,318,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.51,FALSTAFF,"I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in"
318,319,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.52,FALSTAFF,Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the
319,320,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.53,FALSTAFF,"stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived."
320,321,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.54,Page,"Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the"
321,322,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.55,Page,Prince for striking him about Bardolph.
322,323,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.56,FALSTAFF,"Wait, close; I will not see him."
323,324,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.57,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	What's he that goes there?
324,325,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.58,Servant,"Falstaff, an't please your lordship."
325,326,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.59,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	He that was in question for the robbery?
326,327,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.60,Servant,"He, my lord: but he hath since done good service at"
327,328,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.61,Servant,"Shrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some"
328,329,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.62,Servant,charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.
329,330,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.63,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	What, to York? Call him back again."
330,331,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.64,Servant,Sir John Falstaff!
331,332,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.65,FALSTAFF,"Boy, tell him I am deaf."
332,333,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.66,Page,You must speak louder; my master is deaf.
333,334,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.67,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good."
334,335,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.68,Lord Chief-Justice,"Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him."
335,336,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.69,Servant,Sir John!
336,337,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.70,FALSTAFF,"What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not"
337,338,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.71,FALSTAFF,wars? is there not employment? doth not the king
338,339,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.72,FALSTAFF,lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?
339,340,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.73,FALSTAFF,"Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it"
340,341,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.74,FALSTAFF,"is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,"
341,342,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.75,FALSTAFF,were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell
342,343,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.76,FALSTAFF,how to make it.
343,344,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.77,Servant,"You mistake me, sir."
344,345,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.78,FALSTAFF,"Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting"
345,346,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.79,FALSTAFF,"my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied"
346,347,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.80,FALSTAFF,"in my throat, if I had said so."
347,348,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.81,Servant,"I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our"
348,349,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.82,Servant,"soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,"
349,350,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.83,Servant,"you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other"
350,351,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.84,Servant,than an honest man.
351,352,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.85,FALSTAFF,I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that
352,353,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.86,FALSTAFF,"which grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,"
353,354,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.87,FALSTAFF,"hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be"
354,355,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.88,FALSTAFF,hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!
355,356,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.89,Servant,"Sir, my lord would speak with you."
356,357,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.90,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John Falstaff, a word with you."
357,358,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.91,FALSTAFF,My good lord! God give your lordship good time of
358,359,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.92,FALSTAFF,day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard
359,360,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.93,FALSTAFF,say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship
360,361,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.94,FALSTAFF,"goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not"
361,362,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.95,FALSTAFF,"clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in"
362,363,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.96,FALSTAFF,"you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must"
363,364,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.97,FALSTAFF,humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care
364,365,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.98,FALSTAFF,of your health.
365,366,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.99,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to"
366,367,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.100,Lord Chief-Justice,Shrewsbury.
367,368,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.101,FALSTAFF,"An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is"
368,369,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.102,FALSTAFF,returned with some discomfort from Wales.
369,370,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.103,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when
370,371,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.104,Lord Chief-Justice,I sent for you.
371,372,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.105,FALSTAFF,"And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into"
372,373,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.106,FALSTAFF,this same whoreson apoplexy.
373,374,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.107,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with"
374,375,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.108,Lord Chief-Justice,you.
375,376,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.109,FALSTAFF,"This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,"
376,377,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.110,FALSTAFF,n't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the
377,378,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.111,FALSTAFF,"blood, a whoreson tingling."
378,379,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.112,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	What tell you me of it? be it as it is.
379,380,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.113,FALSTAFF,"It hath its original from much grief, from study and"
380,381,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.114,FALSTAFF,perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of
381,382,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.115,FALSTAFF,his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.
382,383,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.116,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	I think you are fallen into the disease; for you
383,384,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.117,Lord Chief-Justice,hear not what I say to you.
384,385,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.118,FALSTAFF,"Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please"
385,386,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.119,FALSTAFF,"you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady"
386,387,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.120,FALSTAFF,"of not marking, that I am troubled withal."
387,388,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.121,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	To punish you by the heels would amend the
388,389,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.122,Lord Chief-Justice,ttention of your ears; and I care not if I do
389,390,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.123,Lord Chief-Justice,become your physician.
390,391,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.124,FALSTAFF,"I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:"
391,392,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.125,FALSTAFF,your lordship may minister the potion of
392,393,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.126,FALSTAFF,imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how
393,394,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.127,FALSTAFF,should I be your patient to follow your
394,395,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.128,FALSTAFF,"prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of "
395,396,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.129,FALSTAFF,"scruple, or indeed a scruple itself."
396,397,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.130,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	I sent for you, when there were matters against you"
397,398,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.131,Lord Chief-Justice,"for your life, to come speak with me."
398,399,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.132,FALSTAFF,As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the
399,400,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.133,FALSTAFF,"laws of this land-service, I did not come."
400,401,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.134,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy."
401,402,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.135,FALSTAFF,He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.
402,403,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.136,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Your means are very slender, and your waste is great."
403,404,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.137,FALSTAFF,I would it were otherwise; I would my means were
404,405,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.138,FALSTAFF,"greater, and my waist slenderer."
405,406,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.139,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	You have misled the youthful prince.
406,407,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.140,FALSTAFF,The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow
407,408,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.141,FALSTAFF,"with the great belly, and he my dog."
408,409,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.142,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your"
409,410,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.143,Lord Chief-Justice,day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded
410,411,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.144,Lord Chief-Justice,over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may
411,412,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.145,Lord Chief-Justice,thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting

413,414,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.147,FALSTAFF,My lord?
414,415,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.148,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	But since all is well, keep it so: wake not "
415,416,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.149,Lord Chief-Justice,sleeping wolf.
416,417,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.150,FALSTAFF,To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.
417,418,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.151,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt"
418,419,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.152,Lord Chief-Justice,out.
419,420,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.153,FALSTAFF,"A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say"
420,421,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.154,FALSTAFF,"of wax, my growth would approve the truth."
421,422,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.155,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	There is not a white hair on your face but should
422,423,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.156,Lord Chief-Justice,have his effect of gravity.
423,424,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.157,FALSTAFF,"His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy."
424,425,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.158,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	You follow the young prince up and down, like his"
425,426,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.159,Lord Chief-Justice,ill angel.
426,427,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.160,FALSTAFF,"Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope"
427,428,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.161,FALSTAFF,he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:
428,429,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.162,FALSTAFF,"nd yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I"
429,430,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.163,FALSTAFF,cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these
430,431,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.164,FALSTAFF,costermonger times that true valour is turned
431,432,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.165,FALSTAFF,"bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath"
432,433,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.166,FALSTAFF,his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the
433,434,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.167,FALSTAFF,"other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of"
434,435,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.168,FALSTAFF,"this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry."
435,436,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.169,FALSTAFF,You that are old consider not the capacities of us
436,437,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.170,FALSTAFF,that are young; you do measure the heat of our
437,438,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.171,FALSTAFF,livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we
438,439,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.172,FALSTAFF,"that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,"
439,440,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.173,FALSTAFF,re wags too.
440,441,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.174,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,"
441,442,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.175,Lord Chief-Justice,that are written down old with all the characters of
442,443,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.176,Lord Chief-Justice,ge? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? 
443,444,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.177,Lord Chief-Justice,yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an
444,445,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.178,Lord Chief-Justice,increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your
445,446,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.179,Lord Chief-Justice,wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and
446,447,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.180,Lord Chief-Justice,every part about you blasted with antiquity? and
447,448,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.181,Lord Chief-Justice,"will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!"
448,449,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.182,FALSTAFF,"My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the"
449,450,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.183,FALSTAFF,"fternoon, with a white head and something a round"
450,451,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.184,FALSTAFF,"belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing"
451,452,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.185,FALSTAFF,nd singing of anthems. To approve my youth
452,453,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.186,FALSTAFF,"further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in"
453,454,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.187,FALSTAFF,judgment and understanding; and he that will caper
454,455,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.188,FALSTAFF,"with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the"
455,456,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.189,FALSTAFF,"money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that"
456,457,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.190,FALSTAFF,"the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,"
457,458,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.191,FALSTAFF,nd you took it like a sensible lord. I have
458,459,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.192,FALSTAFF,"chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;"
459,460,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.193,FALSTAFF,"marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk"
460,461,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.194,FALSTAFF,nd old sack.
461,462,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.195,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God send the prince a better companion!"
462,463,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.196,FALSTAFF,God send the companion a better prince! I cannot
463,464,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.197,FALSTAFF,rid my hands of him.
464,465,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.198,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I"
465,466,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.199,Lord Chief-Justice,hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster
466,467,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.200,Lord Chief-Justice,gainst the Archbishop and the Earl of
467,468,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.201,Lord Chief-Justice,Northumberland.
468,469,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.202,FALSTAFF,Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look
469,470,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.203,FALSTAFF,"you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,"
470,471,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.204,FALSTAFF,"that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the"
471,472,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.205,FALSTAFF,"Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean"
472,473,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.206,FALSTAFF,"not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,"
473,474,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.207,FALSTAFF,"nd I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I"
474,475,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.208,FALSTAFF,might never spit white again. There is not 
475,476,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.209,FALSTAFF,dangerous action can peep out his head but I am
476,477,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.210,FALSTAFF,"thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it"
477,478,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.211,FALSTAFF,"was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if"
478,479,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.212,FALSTAFF,"they have a good thing, to make it too common. If"
479,480,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.213,FALSTAFF,"ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give"
480,481,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.214,FALSTAFF,me rest. I would to God my name were not so
481,482,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.215,FALSTAFF,terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be
482,483,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.216,FALSTAFF,eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to
483,484,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.217,FALSTAFF,nothing with perpetual motion.
484,485,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.218,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your"
485,486,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.219,Lord Chief-Justice,expedition!
486,487,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.220,FALSTAFF,Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to
487,488,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.221,FALSTAFF,furnish me forth?
488,489,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.222,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to"
489,490,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.223,Lord Chief-Justice,bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my
490,491,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.224,Lord Chief-Justice,cousin Westmoreland.
491,492,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.225,FALSTAFF,"If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man"
492,493,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.226,FALSTAFF,can no more separate age and covetousness than a'
493,494,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.227,FALSTAFF,can part young limbs and lechery: but the gout
494,495,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.228,FALSTAFF,"galls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and"
495,496,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.229,FALSTAFF,so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!
496,497,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.230,Page,Sir?
497,498,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.231,FALSTAFF,What money is in my purse?
498,499,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.232,Page,Seven groats and two pence.
499,500,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.233,FALSTAFF,I can get no remedy against this consumption of the
500,501,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.234,FALSTAFF,"purse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,"
501,502,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.235,FALSTAFF,but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter
502,503,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.236,FALSTAFF,to my Lord of Lancaster; this to the prince; this
503,504,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.237,FALSTAFF,to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old
504,505,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.238,FALSTAFF,"Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry"
505,506,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.239,FALSTAFF,since I perceived the first white hair on my chin.
506,507,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.240,FALSTAFF,About it: you know where to find me.
507,508,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.241,FALSTAFF,"A pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox! for"
508,509,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.242,FALSTAFF,the one or the other plays the rogue with my great
509,510,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.243,FALSTAFF,toe. 'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars
510,511,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.244,FALSTAFF,"for my colour, and my pension shall seem the more"
511,512,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.245,FALSTAFF,reasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing:
512,513,"Henry IV, part two",,1.2.246,FALSTAFF,I will turn diseases to commodity.
513,514,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.1,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;
514,515,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.2,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,"
515,516,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.3,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:
516,517,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.4,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?"
517,518,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.5,MOWBRAY,I well allow the occasion of our arms;
518,519,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.6,MOWBRAY,But gladly would be better satisfied
519,520,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.7,MOWBRAY,How in our means we should advance ourselves
520,521,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.8,MOWBRAY,To look with forehead bold and big enough
521,522,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.9,MOWBRAY,Upon the power and puissance of the king.
522,523,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.10,HASTINGS,Our present musters grow upon the file
523,524,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.11,HASTINGS,To five and twenty thousand men of choice;
524,525,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.12,HASTINGS,And our supplies live largely in the hope
525,526,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.13,HASTINGS,"Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns"
526,527,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.14,HASTINGS,With an incensed fire of injuries.
527,528,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.15,LORD BARDOLPH,"The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;"
528,529,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.16,LORD BARDOLPH,Whether our present five and twenty thousand
529,530,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.17,LORD BARDOLPH,May hold up head without Northumberland?
530,531,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.18,HASTINGS,"With him, we may."
531,532,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.19,LORD BARDOLPH,"Yea, marry, there's the point:"
532,533,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.20,LORD BARDOLPH,"But if without him we be thought too feeble,"
533,534,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.21,LORD BARDOLPH,"My judgment is, we should not step too far"
534,535,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.22,LORD BARDOLPH,Till we had his assistance by the hand;
535,536,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.23,LORD BARDOLPH,For in a theme so bloody-faced as this
536,537,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.24,LORD BARDOLPH,"Conjecture, expectation, and surmise"
537,538,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.25,LORD BARDOLPH,Of aids incertain should not be admitted.
538,539,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.26,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed"
539,540,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.27,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.
540,541,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.28,LORD BARDOLPH,"It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,"
541,542,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.29,LORD BARDOLPH,"Eating the air on promise of supply,"
542,543,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.30,LORD BARDOLPH,Flattering himself in project of a power
543,544,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.31,LORD BARDOLPH,Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:
544,545,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.32,LORD BARDOLPH,"And so, with great imagination"
545,546,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.33,LORD BARDOLPH,"Proper to madmen, led his powers to death"
546,547,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.34,LORD BARDOLPH,And winking leap'd into destruction.
547,548,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.35,HASTINGS,"But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt"
548,549,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.36,HASTINGS,To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.
549,550,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.37,LORD BARDOLPH,"Yes, if this present quality of war,"
550,551,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.38,LORD BARDOLPH,Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot
551,552,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.39,LORD BARDOLPH,Lives so in hope as in an early spring
552,553,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.40,LORD BARDOLPH,"We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,"
553,554,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.41,LORD BARDOLPH,Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
554,555,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.42,LORD BARDOLPH,"That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,"
555,556,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.43,LORD BARDOLPH,"We first survey the plot, then draw the model;"
556,557,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.44,LORD BARDOLPH,"And when we see the figure of the house,"
557,558,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.45,LORD BARDOLPH,Then must we rate the cost of the erection;
558,559,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.46,LORD BARDOLPH,"Which if we find outweighs ability,"
559,560,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.47,LORD BARDOLPH,What do we then but draw anew the model
560,561,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.48,LORD BARDOLPH,"In fewer offices, or at last desist"
561,562,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.49,LORD BARDOLPH,"To build at all? Much more, in this great work,"
562,563,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.50,LORD BARDOLPH,Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
563,564,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.51,LORD BARDOLPH,"And set another up, should we survey"
564,565,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.52,LORD BARDOLPH,"The plot of situation and the model,"
565,566,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.53,LORD BARDOLPH,"Consent upon a sure foundation,"
566,567,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.54,LORD BARDOLPH,"Question surveyors, know our own estate,"
567,568,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.55,LORD BARDOLPH,"How able such a work to undergo,"
568,569,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.56,LORD BARDOLPH,To weigh against his opposite; or else
569,570,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.57,LORD BARDOLPH,"We fortify in paper and in figures,"
570,571,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.58,LORD BARDOLPH,Using the names of men instead of men:
571,572,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.59,LORD BARDOLPH,Like one that draws the model of a house
572,573,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.60,LORD BARDOLPH,"Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,"
573,574,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.61,LORD BARDOLPH,Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost
574,575,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.62,LORD BARDOLPH,A naked subject to the weeping clouds
575,576,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.63,LORD BARDOLPH,And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.
576,577,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.64,HASTINGS,"Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,"
577,578,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.65,HASTINGS,"Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd"
578,579,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.66,HASTINGS,"The utmost man of expectation,"
579,580,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.67,HASTINGS,"I think we are a body strong enough,"
580,581,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.68,HASTINGS,"Even as we are, to equal with the king."
581,582,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.69,LORD BARDOLPH,"What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?"
582,583,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.70,HASTINGS,"To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph."
583,584,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.71,HASTINGS,"For his divisions, as the times do brawl,"
584,585,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.72,HASTINGS,"Are in three heads: one power against the French,"
585,586,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.73,HASTINGS,And one against Glendower; perforce a third
586,587,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.74,HASTINGS,Must take up us: so is the unfirm king
587,588,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.75,HASTINGS,In three divided; and his coffers sound
588,589,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.76,HASTINGS,With hollow poverty and emptiness.
589,590,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.77,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,That he should draw his several strengths together
590,591,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.78,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And come against us in full puissance,"
591,592,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.79,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Need not be dreaded.
592,593,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.80,HASTINGS,"If he should do so,"
593,594,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.81,HASTINGS,"He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh"
594,595,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.82,HASTINGS,Baying him at the heels: never fear that.
595,596,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.83,LORD BARDOLPH,Who is it like should lead his forces hither?
596,597,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.84,HASTINGS,The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;
597,598,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.85,HASTINGS,"Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:"
598,599,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.86,HASTINGS,"But who is substituted 'gainst the French,"
599,600,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.87,HASTINGS,I have no certain notice.
600,601,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.88,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Let us on,"
601,602,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.89,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And publish the occasion of our arms.
602,603,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.90,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
603,604,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.91,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:
604,605,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.92,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,An habitation giddy and unsure
605,606,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.93,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
606,607,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.94,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"O thou fond many, with what loud applause"
607,608,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.95,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,"
608,609,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.96,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!
609,610,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.97,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,"
610,611,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.98,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,"
611,612,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.99,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.
612,613,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.100,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge"
613,614,"Henry IV, part two",,1.3.101,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;

659,660,"Henry IV, part two",,2.1.33,MISTRESS QUICKLY,dealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and 
660,661,"Henry IV, part two",,2.1.34,MISTRESS QUICKLY,"beast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder he"
661,662,"Henry IV, part two",,2.1.35,MISTRESS QUICKLY,"comes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,"

691,692,"Henry IV, part two",,2.1.65,MISTRESS QUICKLY,ll I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;
692,693,"Henry IV, part two",,2.1.66,MISTRESS QUICKLY,he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of

808,809,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.3,POINS,have attached one of so high blood.
809,810,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.4,PRINCE HENRY,"Faith, it does me; though it discolours the"
810,811,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.5,PRINCE HENRY,complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth

812,813,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.7,POINS,"Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as"

814,815,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.9,PRINCE HENRY,"Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,"

816,817,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.11,PRINCE HENRY,"small beer. But, indeed, these humble"
817,818,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.12,PRINCE HENRY,considerations make me out of love with my
818,819,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.13,PRINCE HENRY,greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember
819,820,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.14,PRINCE HENRY,thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to
820,821,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.15,PRINCE HENRY,take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
821,822,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.16,PRINCE HENRY,"hast, viz. these, and those that were thy"
822,823,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.17,PRINCE HENRY,peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy

824,825,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.19,PRINCE HENRY,use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better
825,826,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.20,PRINCE HENRY,than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
826,827,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.21,PRINCE HENRY,thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done
827,828,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.22,PRINCE HENRY," great while, because the rest of thy low"
828,829,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.23,PRINCE HENRY,countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:
829,830,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.24,PRINCE HENRY,"nd God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins"
830,831,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.25,PRINCE HENRY,of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the

832,833,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.27,PRINCE HENRY,"whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are"
833,834,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.28,PRINCE HENRY,mightily strengthened.
834,835,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.29,POINS,"How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,"
835,836,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.30,POINS,"you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good"

840,841,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.35,PRINCE HENRY,It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.
841,842,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.36,POINS,Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you
842,843,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.37,POINS,will tell.
843,844,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.38,PRINCE HENRY,"Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be"
844,845,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.39,PRINCE HENRY,"sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell"
845,846,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.40,PRINCE HENRY,"thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of "
846,847,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.41,PRINCE HENRY,"better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad"
847,848,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.42,PRINCE HENRY,indeed too.
848,849,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.43,POINS,Very hardly upon such a subject.
849,850,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.44,PRINCE HENRY,By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
850,851,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.45,PRINCE HENRY,book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and
851,852,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.46,PRINCE HENRY,persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell
852,853,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.47,PRINCE HENRY,"thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so"
853,854,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.48,PRINCE HENRY,sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art
854,855,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.49,PRINCE HENRY,hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.
855,856,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.50,POINS,The reason?
856,857,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.51,PRINCE HENRY,"What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?"
857,858,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.52,POINS,I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.
858,859,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.53,PRINCE HENRY,It would be every man's thought; and thou art 
859,860,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.54,PRINCE HENRY,blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never

862,863,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.57,PRINCE HENRY,hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most
863,864,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.58,PRINCE HENRY,worshipful thought to think so?
864,865,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.59,POINS,"Why, because you have been so lewd and so much"
865,866,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.60,POINS,engraffed to Falstaff.
866,867,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.61,PRINCE HENRY,And to thee.

868,869,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.63,POINS,with my own ears: the worst that they can say of
869,870,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.64,POINS,me is that I am a second brother and that I am 
870,871,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.65,POINS,"proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I"
871,872,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.66,POINS,"confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph."
872,873,"Henry IV, part two",,2.2.67,PRINCE HENRY,And the boy that I gave Falstaff: a' had him from

1774,1776,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.253,BARDOLPH,"Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus."
1775,1777,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.254,FALSTAFF,"Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: go"
1776,1778,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.255,FALSTAFF,"to: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always "
1777,1779,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.256,FALSTAFF,"little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i'"
1778,1780,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.257,FALSTAFF,"faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's "
1779,1781,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.258,FALSTAFF,tester for thee.
1780,1782,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.259,SHALLOW,He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it
1781,1783,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.260,SHALLOW,"right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at"
1782,1784,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.261,SHALLOW,Clement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's
1783,1785,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.262,SHALLOW,"show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'"
1784,1786,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.263,SHALLOW,would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about
1785,1787,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.264,SHALLOW,"nd about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,"
1786,1788,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.265,SHALLOW,"tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and"
1787,1789,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.266,SHALLOW,"way again would a' go, and again would a' come: I"
1788,1790,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.267,SHALLOW,shall ne'er see such a fellow.
1789,1791,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.268,FALSTAFF,"These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God"
1790,1792,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.269,FALSTAFF,"keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words"
1791,1793,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.270,FALSTAFF,"with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank"
1792,1794,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.271,FALSTAFF,"you: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give"
1793,1795,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.272,FALSTAFF,the soldiers coats.
1794,1796,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.273,SHALLOW,"Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper your"
1795,1797,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.274,SHALLOW,ffairs! God send us peace! At your return visit
1796,1798,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.275,SHALLOW,our house; let our old acquaintance be renewed;
1797,1799,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.276,SHALLOW,peradventure I will with ye to the court.
1798,1800,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.277,FALSTAFF,"Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow."
1799,1801,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.278,SHALLOW,Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.
1800,1802,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.279,FALSTAFF,"Fare you well, gentle gentlemen."
1801,1803,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.280,FALSTAFF,"On, Bardolph; lead the men away."
1802,1804,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.281,FALSTAFF,"As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do"
1803,1805,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.282,FALSTAFF,"see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how"
1804,1806,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.283,FALSTAFF,subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This
1805,1807,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.284,FALSTAFF,same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to
1806,1808,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.285,FALSTAFF,"me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he"
1807,1809,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.286,FALSTAFF,hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third
1808,1810,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.287,FALSTAFF,"word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's"
1809,1811,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.288,FALSTAFF,tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like 
1810,1812,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.289,FALSTAFF,man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'
1811,1813,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.290,FALSTAFF,"was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked"
1812,1814,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.291,FALSTAFF,"radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it"
1813,1815,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.292,FALSTAFF,"with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his"
1814,1816,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.293,FALSTAFF,dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'
1815,1817,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.294,FALSTAFF,was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as 
1816,1818,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.295,FALSTAFF,"monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came"
1817,1819,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.296,FALSTAFF,"ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those"
1818,1820,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.297,FALSTAFF,tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
1819,1821,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.298,FALSTAFF,"carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or"
1820,1822,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.299,FALSTAFF,his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger
1821,1823,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.300,FALSTAFF,"become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John "
1822,1824,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.301,FALSTAFF,Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and
1823,1825,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.302,FALSTAFF,I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the
1824,1826,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.303,FALSTAFF,Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding
1825,1827,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.304,FALSTAFF,"mong the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John "
1826,1828,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.305,FALSTAFF,Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have
1827,1829,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.306,FALSTAFF,thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the
1828,1830,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.307,FALSTAFF,"case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, "
1829,1831,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.308,FALSTAFF,"court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll"
1830,1832,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.309,FALSTAFF,"be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall"
1831,1833,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.310,FALSTAFF,go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two
1832,1834,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.311,FALSTAFF,stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the
1833,1835,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.312,FALSTAFF,"old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I"
1834,1836,"Henry IV, part two",,3.2.313,FALSTAFF,"may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end."
1835,1837,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.1,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,What is this forest call'd?
1836,1838,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.2,HASTINGS,"Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your grace."
1837,1839,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.3,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forth"
1838,1840,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.4,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,To know the numbers of our enemies.
1839,1841,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.5,HASTINGS,We have sent forth already.
1840,1842,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.6,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Tis well done.
1841,1843,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.7,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"My friends and brethren in these great affairs,"
1842,1844,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.8,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,I must acquaint you that I have received
1843,1845,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.9,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,New-dated letters from Northumberland;
1844,1846,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.10,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:"
1845,1847,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.11,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Here doth he wish his person, with such powers"
1846,1848,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.12,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"As might hold sortance with his quality,"
1847,1849,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.13,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,The which he could not levy; whereupon
1848,1850,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.14,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,"
1849,1851,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.15,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers
1850,1852,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.16,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,That your attempts may overlive the hazard
1851,1853,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.17,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And fearful melting of their opposite.
1852,1854,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.18,MOWBRAY,Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
1853,1855,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.19,MOWBRAY,And dash themselves to pieces.
1854,1856,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.20,HASTINGS,"Now, what news?"
1855,1857,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.21,Messenger,"West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,"
1856,1858,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.22,Messenger,In goodly form comes on the enemy;
1857,1859,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.23,Messenger,"And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number"
1858,1860,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.24,Messenger,Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.
1859,1861,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.25,MOWBRAY,The just proportion that we gave them out
1860,1862,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.26,MOWBRAY,Let us sway on and face them in the field.
1861,1863,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.27,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
1862,1864,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.28,MOWBRAY,I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.
1863,1865,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.29,WESTMORELAND,"Health and fair greeting from our general,"
1864,1866,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.30,WESTMORELAND,"The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster."
1865,1867,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.31,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:"
1866,1868,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.32,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,What doth concern your coming?
1867,1869,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.33,WESTMORELAND,"Then, my lord,"
1868,1870,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.34,WESTMORELAND,Unto your grace do I in chief address
1869,1871,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.35,WESTMORELAND,The substance of my speech. If that rebellion
1870,1872,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.36,WESTMORELAND,"Came like itself, in base and abject routs,"
1871,1873,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.37,WESTMORELAND,"Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,"
1872,1874,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.38,WESTMORELAND,"And countenanced by boys and beggary,"
1873,1875,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.39,WESTMORELAND,"I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,"
1874,1876,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.40,WESTMORELAND,"In his true, native and most proper shape,"
1875,1877,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.41,WESTMORELAND,"You, reverend father, and these noble lords"
1876,1878,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.42,WESTMORELAND,"Had not been here, to dress the ugly form"
1877,1879,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.43,WESTMORELAND,Of base and bloody insurrection
1878,1880,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.44,WESTMORELAND,"With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,"
1879,1881,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.45,WESTMORELAND,"Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,"
1880,1882,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.46,WESTMORELAND,"Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,"
1881,1883,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.47,WESTMORELAND,"Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,"
1882,1884,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.48,WESTMORELAND,"Whose white investments figure innocence,"
1883,1885,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.49,WESTMORELAND,"The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,"
1884,1886,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.50,WESTMORELAND,Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself
1885,1887,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.51,WESTMORELAND,"Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,"
1886,1888,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.52,WESTMORELAND,Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;
1887,1889,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.53,WESTMORELAND,"Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,"
1888,1890,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.54,WESTMORELAND,Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
1889,1891,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.55,WESTMORELAND,To a trumpet and a point of war?
1890,1892,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.56,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.
1891,1893,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.57,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,"
1892,1894,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.58,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
1893,1895,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.59,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,"
1894,1896,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.60,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And we must bleed for it; of which disease
1895,1897,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.61,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Our late king, Richard, being infected, died."
1896,1898,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.62,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,"
1897,1899,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.63,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"I take not on me here as a physician,"
1898,1900,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.64,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Nor do I as an enemy to peace
1899,1901,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.65,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Troop in the throngs of military men;
1900,1902,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.66,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"But rather show awhile like fearful war,"
1901,1903,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.67,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,To diet rank minds sick of happiness
1902,1904,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.68,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And purge the obstructions which begin to stop
1903,1905,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.69,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.
1904,1906,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.70,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,I have in equal balance justly weigh'd
1905,1907,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.71,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,"
1906,1908,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.72,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
1907,1909,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.73,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"We see which way the stream of time doth run,"
1908,1910,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.74,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And are enforced from our most quiet there
1909,1911,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.75,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,By the rough torrent of occasion;
1910,1912,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.76,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And have the summary of all our griefs,"
1911,1913,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.77,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"When time shall serve, to show in articles;"
1912,1914,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.78,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,"
1913,1915,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.79,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And might by no suit gain our audience:
1914,1916,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.80,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,"
1915,1917,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.81,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,We are denied access unto his person
1916,1918,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.82,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
1917,1919,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.83,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The dangers of the days but newly gone,"
1918,1920,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.84,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Whose memory is written on the earth
1919,1921,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.85,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"With yet appearing blood, and the examples"
1920,1922,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.86,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Of every minute's instance, present now,"
1921,1923,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.87,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,"
1922,1924,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.88,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Not to break peace or any branch of it,"
1923,1925,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.89,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"But to establish here a peace indeed,"
1924,1926,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.90,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Concurring both in name and quality.
1925,1927,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.91,WESTMORELAND,When ever yet was your appeal denied?
1926,1928,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.92,WESTMORELAND,Wherein have you been galled by the king?
1927,1929,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.93,WESTMORELAND,"What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,"
1928,1930,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.94,WESTMORELAND,That you should seal this lawless bloody book
1929,1931,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.95,WESTMORELAND,Of forged rebellion with a seal divine
1930,1932,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.96,WESTMORELAND,And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?
1931,1933,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.97,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"My brother general, the commonwealth,"
1932,1934,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.98,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To brother born an household cruelty,"
1933,1935,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.99,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,I make my quarrel in particular.
1934,1936,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.100,WESTMORELAND,There is no need of any such redress;
1935,1937,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.101,WESTMORELAND,"Or if there were, it not belongs to you."
1936,1938,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.102,MOWBRAY,"Why not to him in part, and to us all"
1937,1939,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.103,MOWBRAY,"That feel the bruises of the days before,"
1938,1940,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.104,MOWBRAY,And suffer the condition of these times
1939,1941,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.105,MOWBRAY,To lay a heavy and unequal hand
1940,1942,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.106,MOWBRAY,Upon our honours?
1941,1943,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.107,WESTMORELAND,"O, my good Lord Mowbray,"
1942,1944,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.108,WESTMORELAND,"Construe the times to their necessities,"
1943,1945,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.109,WESTMORELAND,"And you shall say indeed, it is the time,"
1944,1946,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.110,WESTMORELAND,"And not the king, that doth you injuries."
1945,1947,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.111,WESTMORELAND,"Yet for your part, it not appears to me"
1946,1948,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.112,WESTMORELAND,Either from the king or in the present time
1947,1949,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.113,WESTMORELAND,That you should have an inch of any ground
1948,1950,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.114,WESTMORELAND,To build a grief on: were you not restored
1949,1951,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.115,WESTMORELAND,"To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,"
1950,1952,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.116,WESTMORELAND,Your noble and right well remember'd father's?
1951,1953,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.117,MOWBRAY,"What thing, in honour, had my father lost,"
1952,1954,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.118,MOWBRAY,That need to be revived and breathed in me?
1953,1955,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.119,MOWBRAY,"The king that loved him, as the state stood then,"
1954,1956,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.120,MOWBRAY,Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:
1955,1957,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.121,MOWBRAY,"And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,"
1956,1958,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.122,MOWBRAY,"Being mounted and both roused in their seats,"
1957,1959,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.123,MOWBRAY,"Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,"
1958,1960,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.124,MOWBRAY,"Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,"
1959,1961,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.125,MOWBRAY,Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel
1960,1962,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.126,MOWBRAY,"And the loud trumpet blowing them together,"
1961,1963,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.127,MOWBRAY,"Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd"
1962,1964,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.128,MOWBRAY,"My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,"
1963,1965,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.129,MOWBRAY,"O when the king did throw his warder down,"
1964,1966,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.130,MOWBRAY,His own life hung upon the staff he threw;
1965,1967,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.131,MOWBRAY,Then threw he down himself and all their lives
1966,1968,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.132,MOWBRAY,That by indictment and by dint of sword
1967,1969,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.133,MOWBRAY,Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.
1968,1970,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.134,WESTMORELAND,"You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what."
1969,1971,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.135,WESTMORELAND,The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
1970,1972,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.136,WESTMORELAND,In England the most valiant gentlemen:
1971,1973,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.137,WESTMORELAND,Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?
1972,1974,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.138,WESTMORELAND,"But if your father had been victor there,"
1973,1975,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.139,WESTMORELAND,He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:
1974,1976,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.140,WESTMORELAND,For all the country in a general voice
1975,1977,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.141,WESTMORELAND,Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
1976,1978,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.142,WESTMORELAND,"Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on"
1977,1979,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.143,WESTMORELAND,"And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king."
1978,1980,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.144,WESTMORELAND,But this is mere digression from my purpose.
1979,1981,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.145,WESTMORELAND,Here come I from our princely general
1980,1982,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.146,WESTMORELAND,To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace
1981,1983,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.147,WESTMORELAND,That he will give you audience; and wherein
1982,1984,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.148,WESTMORELAND,"It shall appear that your demands are just,"
1983,1985,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.149,WESTMORELAND,"You shall enjoy them, every thing set off"
1984,1986,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.150,WESTMORELAND,That might so much as think you enemies.
1985,1987,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.151,MOWBRAY,But he hath forced us to compel this offer;
1986,1988,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.152,MOWBRAY,"And it proceeds from policy, not love."
1987,1989,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.153,WESTMORELAND,"Mowbray, you overween to take it so;"
1988,1990,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.154,WESTMORELAND,"This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:"
1989,1991,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.155,WESTMORELAND,"For, lo! within a ken our army lies,"
1990,1992,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.156,WESTMORELAND,"Upon mine honour, all too confident"
1991,1993,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.157,WESTMORELAND,To give admittance to a thought of fear.
1992,1994,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.158,WESTMORELAND,"Our battle is more full of names than yours,"
1993,1995,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.159,WESTMORELAND,"Our men more perfect in the use of arms,"
1994,1996,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.160,WESTMORELAND,"Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;"
1995,1997,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.161,WESTMORELAND,Then reason will our heart should be as good
1996,1998,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.162,WESTMORELAND,Say you not then our offer is compell'd.
1997,1999,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.163,MOWBRAY,"Well, by my will we shall admit no parley."
1998,2000,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.164,WESTMORELAND,That argues but the shame of your offence:
1999,2001,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.165,WESTMORELAND,A rotten case abides no handling.
2000,2002,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.166,HASTINGS,"Hath the Prince John a full commission,"
2001,2003,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.167,HASTINGS,"In very ample virtue of his father,"
2002,2004,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.168,HASTINGS,To hear and absolutely to determine
2003,2005,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.169,HASTINGS,Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
2004,2006,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.170,WESTMORELAND,That is intended in the general's name:
2005,2007,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.171,WESTMORELAND,I muse you make so slight a question.
2006,2008,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.172,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,"
2007,2009,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.173,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,For this contains our general grievances:
2008,2010,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.174,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Each several article herein redress'd,"
2009,2011,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.175,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"All members of our cause, both here and hence,"
2010,2012,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.176,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"That are insinew'd to this action,"
2011,2013,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.177,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Acquitted by a true substantial form
2012,2014,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.178,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And present execution of our wills
2013,2015,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.179,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To us and to our purposes confined,"
2014,2016,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.180,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,We come within our awful banks again
2015,2017,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.181,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And knit our powers to the arm of peace.
2016,2018,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.182,WESTMORELAND,"This will I show the general. Please you, lords,"
2017,2019,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.183,WESTMORELAND,In sight of both our battles we may meet;
2018,2020,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.184,WESTMORELAND,"And either end in peace, which God so frame!"
2019,2021,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.185,WESTMORELAND,Or to the place of difference call the swords
2020,2022,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.186,WESTMORELAND,Which must decide it.
2021,2023,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.187,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"My lord, we will do so."
2022,2024,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.188,MOWBRAY,There is a thing within my bosom tells me
2023,2025,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.189,MOWBRAY,That no conditions of our peace can stand.
2024,2026,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.190,HASTINGS,Fear you not that: if we can make our peace
2025,2027,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.191,HASTINGS,Upon such large terms and so absolute
2026,2028,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.192,HASTINGS,"As our conditions shall consist upon,"
2027,2029,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.193,HASTINGS,Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.
2028,2030,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.194,MOWBRAY,"Yea, but our valuation shall be such"
2029,2031,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.195,MOWBRAY,"That every slight and false-derived cause,"
2030,2032,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.196,MOWBRAY,"Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason"
2031,2033,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.197,MOWBRAY,Shall to the king taste of this action;
2032,2034,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.198,MOWBRAY,"That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,"
2033,2035,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.199,MOWBRAY,We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
2034,2036,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.200,MOWBRAY,That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
2035,2037,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.201,MOWBRAY,And good from bad find no partition.
2036,2038,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.202,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary"
2037,2039,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.203,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Of dainty and such picking grievances:
2038,2040,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.204,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,For he hath found to end one doubt by death
2039,2041,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.205,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Revives two greater in the heirs of life,"
2040,2042,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.206,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
2041,2043,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.207,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And keep no tell-tale to his memory
2042,2044,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.208,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,That may repeat and history his loss
2043,2045,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.209,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,To new remembrance; for full well he knows
2044,2046,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.210,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,He cannot so precisely weed this land
2045,2047,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.211,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,As his misdoubts present occasion:
2046,2048,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.212,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,His foes are so enrooted with his friends
2047,2049,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.213,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"That, plucking to unfix an enemy,"
2048,2050,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.214,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:
2049,2051,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.215,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"So that this land, like an offensive wife"
2050,2052,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.216,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,"
2051,2053,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.217,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"As he is striking, holds his infant up"
2052,2054,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.218,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And hangs resolved correction in the arm
2053,2055,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.219,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,That was uprear'd to execution.
2054,2056,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.220,HASTINGS,"Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods"
2055,2057,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.221,HASTINGS,"On late offenders, that he now doth lack"
2056,2058,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.222,HASTINGS,The very instruments of chastisement:
2057,2059,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.223,HASTINGS,"So that his power, like to a fangless lion,"
2058,2060,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.224,HASTINGS,"May offer, but not hold."
2059,2061,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.225,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Tis very true:
2060,2062,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.226,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,"
2061,2063,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.227,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"If we do now make our atonement well,"
2062,2064,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.228,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Our peace will, like a broken limb united,"
2063,2065,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.229,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Grow stronger for the breaking.
2064,2066,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.230,MOWBRAY,Be it so.
2065,2067,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.231,MOWBRAY,Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.
2066,2068,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.232,WESTMORELAND,The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship
2067,2069,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.233,WESTMORELAND,To meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.
2068,2070,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.234,MOWBRAY,"Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward."
2069,2071,"Henry IV, part two",,4.1.235,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come."
2070,2072,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.1,LANCASTER,"You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:"
2071,2073,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.2,LANCASTER,"Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;"
2072,2074,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.3,LANCASTER,"And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all."
2073,2075,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.4,LANCASTER,"My Lord of York, it better show'd with you"
2074,2076,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.5,LANCASTER,"When that your flock, assembled by the bell,"
2075,2077,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.6,LANCASTER,Encircled you to hear with reverence
2076,2078,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.7,LANCASTER,Your exposition on the holy text
2077,2079,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.8,LANCASTER,"Than now to see you here an iron man,"
2078,2080,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.9,LANCASTER,"Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,"
2079,2081,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.10,LANCASTER,Turning the word to sword and life to death.
2080,2082,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.11,LANCASTER,"That man that sits within a monarch's heart,"
2081,2083,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.12,LANCASTER,"And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,"
2082,2084,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.13,LANCASTER,"Would he abuse the countenance of the king,"
2083,2085,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.14,LANCASTER,"Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch"
2084,2086,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.15,LANCASTER,"In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,"
2085,2087,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.16,LANCASTER,It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken
2086,2088,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.17,LANCASTER,How deep you were within the books of God?
2087,2089,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.18,LANCASTER,To us the speaker in his parliament;
2088,2090,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.19,LANCASTER,To us the imagined voice of God himself;
2089,2091,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.20,LANCASTER,The very opener and intelligencer
2090,2092,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.21,LANCASTER,"Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven"
2091,2093,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.22,LANCASTER,"And our dull workings. O, who shall believe"
2092,2094,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.23,LANCASTER,"But you misuse the reverence of your place,"
2093,2095,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.24,LANCASTER,"Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,"
2094,2096,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.25,LANCASTER,"As a false favourite doth his prince's name,"
2095,2097,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.26,LANCASTER,"In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,"
2096,2098,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.27,LANCASTER,"Under the counterfeited zeal of God,"
2097,2099,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.28,LANCASTER,"The subjects of his substitute, my father,"
2098,2100,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.29,LANCASTER,And both against the peace of heaven and him
2099,2101,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.30,LANCASTER,Have here up-swarm'd them.
2100,2102,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.31,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Good my Lord of Lancaster,"
2101,2103,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.32,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,I am not here against your father's peace;
2102,2104,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.33,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,"
2103,2105,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.34,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,"
2104,2106,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.35,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,"
2105,2107,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.36,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,To hold our safety up. I sent your grace
2106,2108,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.37,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The parcels and particulars of our grief,"
2107,2109,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.38,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,"
2108,2110,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.39,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;
2109,2111,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.40,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
2110,2112,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.41,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"With grant of our most just and right desires,"
2111,2113,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.42,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And true obedience, of this madness cured,"
2112,2114,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.43,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.
2113,2115,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.44,MOWBRAY,"If not, we ready are to try our fortunes"
2114,2116,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.45,MOWBRAY,To the last man.
2115,2117,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.46,HASTINGS,"And though we here fall down,"
2116,2118,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.47,HASTINGS,We have supplies to second our attempt:
2117,2119,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.48,HASTINGS,"If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;"
2118,2120,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.49,HASTINGS,And so success of mischief shall be born
2119,2121,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.50,HASTINGS,And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
2120,2122,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.51,HASTINGS,Whiles England shall have generation.
2121,2123,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.52,LANCASTER,"You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,"
2122,2124,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.53,LANCASTER,To sound the bottom of the after-times.
2123,2125,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.54,WESTMORELAND,Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
2124,2126,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.55,WESTMORELAND,How far forth you do like their articles.
2125,2127,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.56,LANCASTER,"I like them all, and do allow them well,"
2126,2128,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.57,LANCASTER,"And swear here, by the honour of my blood,"
2127,2129,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.58,LANCASTER,"My father's purposes have been mistook,"
2128,2130,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.59,LANCASTER,And some about him have too lavishly
2129,2131,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.60,LANCASTER,Wrested his meaning and authority.
2130,2132,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.61,LANCASTER,"My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;"
2131,2133,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.62,LANCASTER,"Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,"
2132,2134,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.63,LANCASTER,"Discharge your powers unto their several counties,"
2133,2135,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.64,LANCASTER,As we will ours: and here between the armies
2134,2136,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.65,LANCASTER,"Let's drink together friendly and embrace,"
2135,2137,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.66,LANCASTER,That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
2136,2138,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.67,LANCASTER,Of our restored love and amity.
2137,2139,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.68,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,I take your princely word for these redresses.
2138,2140,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.69,LANCASTER,"I give it you, and will maintain my word:"
2139,2141,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.70,LANCASTER,And thereupon I drink unto your grace.
2140,2142,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.71,HASTINGS,"Go, captain, and deliver to the army"
2141,2143,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.72,HASTINGS,"This news of peace: let them have pay, and part:"
2142,2144,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.73,HASTINGS,"I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain."
2143,2145,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.74,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland."
2144,2146,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.75,WESTMORELAND,"I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains"
2145,2147,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.76,WESTMORELAND,"I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,"
2146,2148,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.77,WESTMORELAND,You would drink freely: but my love to ye
2147,2149,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.78,WESTMORELAND,Shall show itself more openly hereafter.
2148,2150,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.79,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,I do not doubt you.
2149,2151,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.80,WESTMORELAND,I am glad of it.
2150,2152,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.81,WESTMORELAND,"Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray."
2151,2153,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.82,MOWBRAY,You wish me health in very happy season;
2152,2154,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.83,MOWBRAY,"For I am, on the sudden, something ill."
2153,2155,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.84,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Against ill chances men are ever merry;
2154,2156,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.85,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,But heaviness foreruns the good event.
2155,2157,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.86,WESTMORELAND,"Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow"
2156,2158,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.87,WESTMORELAND,"Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes"
2157,2159,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.88,WESTMORELAND,to-morrow.'
2158,2160,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.89,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Believe me, I am passing light in spirit."
2159,2161,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.90,MOWBRAY,"So much the worse, if your own rule be true."
2160,2162,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.91,LANCASTER,"The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!"
2161,2163,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.92,MOWBRAY,This had been cheerful after victory.
2162,2164,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.93,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,A peace is of the nature of a conquest;
2163,2165,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.94,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"For then both parties nobly are subdued,"
2164,2166,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.95,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And neither party loser.
2165,2167,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.96,LANCASTER,"Go, my lord,"
2166,2168,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.97,LANCASTER,And let our army be discharged too.
2167,2169,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.98,LANCASTER,"And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains"
2168,2170,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.99,LANCASTER,"March, by us, that we may peruse the men"
2169,2171,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.100,LANCASTER,We should have coped withal.
2170,2172,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.101,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Go, good Lord Hastings,"
2171,2173,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.102,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And, ere they be dismissed, let them march by."
2172,2174,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.103,LANCASTER,"I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together."
2173,2175,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.104,LANCASTER,"Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?"
2174,2176,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.105,WESTMORELAND,"The leaders, having charge from you to stand,"
2175,2177,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.106,WESTMORELAND,Will not go off until they hear you speak.
2176,2178,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.107,LANCASTER,They know their duties.
2177,2179,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.108,HASTINGS,"My lord, our army is dispersed already;"
2178,2180,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.109,HASTINGS,"Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses"
2179,2181,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.110,HASTINGS,"East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,"
2180,2182,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.111,HASTINGS,Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.
2181,2183,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.112,WESTMORELAND,"Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which"
2182,2184,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.113,WESTMORELAND,"I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:"
2183,2185,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.114,WESTMORELAND,"And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,"
2184,2186,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.115,WESTMORELAND,Of capitol treason I attach you both.
2185,2187,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.116,MOWBRAY,Is this proceeding just and honourable?
2186,2188,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.117,WESTMORELAND,Is your assembly so?
2187,2189,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.118,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Will you thus break your faith?
2188,2190,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.119,LANCASTER,I pawn'd thee none:
2189,2191,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.120,LANCASTER,I promised you redress of these same grievances
2190,2192,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.121,LANCASTER,"Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,"
2191,2193,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.122,LANCASTER,I will perform with a most Christian care.
2192,2194,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.123,LANCASTER,"But for you, rebels, look to taste the due"
2193,2195,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.124,LANCASTER,Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.
2194,2196,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.125,LANCASTER,"Most shallowly did you these arms commence,"
2195,2197,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.126,LANCASTER,Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.
2196,2198,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.127,LANCASTER,"Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:"
2197,2199,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.128,LANCASTER,"God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day."
2198,2200,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.129,LANCASTER,"Some guard these traitors to the block of death,"
2199,2201,"Henry IV, part two",,4.2.130,LANCASTER,Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.
2200,2202,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.1,FALSTAFF,"What's your name, sir? of what condition are you,"
2201,2203,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.2,FALSTAFF,"nd of what place, I pray?"
2202,2204,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.3,COLEVILE,"I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the dale."
2203,2205,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.4,FALSTAFF,"Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your"
2204,2206,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.5,FALSTAFF,"degree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall be"
2205,2207,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.6,FALSTAFF,"still your name, a traitor your degree, and the"
2206,2208,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.7,FALSTAFF,"dungeon your place, a place deep enough; so shall"
2207,2209,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.8,FALSTAFF,you be still Colevile of the dale.
2208,2210,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.9,COLEVILE,Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
2209,2211,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.10,FALSTAFF,"As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye"
2210,2212,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.11,FALSTAFF,"yield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I do"
2211,2213,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.12,FALSTAFF,"sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they"
2212,2214,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.13,FALSTAFF,weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and
2213,2215,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.14,FALSTAFF,"trembling, and do observance to my mercy."
2214,2216,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.15,COLEVILE,"I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that"
2215,2217,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.16,COLEVILE,thought yield me.
2216,2218,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.17,FALSTAFF,I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of
2217,2219,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.18,FALSTAFF,"mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other"
2218,2220,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.19,FALSTAFF,word but my name. An I had but a belly of any
2219,2221,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.20,FALSTAFF,"indifference, I were simply the most active fellow"
2220,2222,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.21,FALSTAFF,"in Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me."
2221,2223,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.22,FALSTAFF,Here comes our general.
2222,2224,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.23,LANCASTER,The heat is past; follow no further now:
2223,2225,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.24,LANCASTER,"Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland."
2224,2226,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.25,LANCASTER,"Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?"
2225,2227,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.26,LANCASTER,"When every thing is ended, then you come:"
2226,2228,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.27,LANCASTER,"These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,"
2227,2229,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.28,LANCASTER,One time or other break some gallows' back.
2228,2230,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.29,FALSTAFF,"I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I"
2229,2231,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.30,FALSTAFF,never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward
2230,2232,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.31,FALSTAFF,"of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or "
2231,2233,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.32,FALSTAFF,"bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the"
2232,2234,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.33,FALSTAFF,expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with
2233,2235,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.34,FALSTAFF,the very extremest inch of possibility; I have
2234,2236,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.35,FALSTAFF,"foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,"
2235,2237,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.36,FALSTAFF,"travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and"
2236,2238,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.37,FALSTAFF,"immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the"
2237,2239,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.38,FALSTAFF,"dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy."
2238,2240,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.39,FALSTAFF,"But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I"
2239,2241,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.40,FALSTAFF,"may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,"
2240,2242,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.41,FALSTAFF,"I came, saw, and overcame.'"
2241,2243,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.42,LANCASTER,It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.
2242,2244,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.43,FALSTAFF,"I know not: here he is, and here I yield him: and"
2243,2245,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.44,FALSTAFF,"I beseech your grace, let it be booked with the"
2244,2246,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.45,FALSTAFF,"rest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will"
2245,2247,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.46,FALSTAFF,"have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own"
2246,2248,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.47,FALSTAFF,"picture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:"
2247,2249,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.48,FALSTAFF,"to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not"
2248,2250,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.49,FALSTAFF,"ll show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the"
2249,2251,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.50,FALSTAFF,clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full
2250,2252,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.51,FALSTAFF,"moon doth the cinders of the element, which show"
2251,2253,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.52,FALSTAFF,"like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of"
2252,2254,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.53,FALSTAFF,"the noble: therefore let me have right, and let"
2253,2255,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.54,FALSTAFF,desert mount.
2254,2256,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.55,LANCASTER,Thine's too heavy to mount.
2255,2257,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.56,FALSTAFF,"Let it shine, then."
2256,2258,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.57,LANCASTER,Thine's too thick to shine.
2257,2259,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.58,FALSTAFF,"Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me"
2258,2260,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.59,FALSTAFF,"good, and call it what you will."
2259,2261,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.60,LANCASTER,Is thy name Colevile?
2260,2262,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.61,COLEVILE,"It is, my lord."
2261,2263,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.62,LANCASTER,"A famous rebel art thou, Colevile."
2262,2264,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.63,FALSTAFF,And a famous true subject took him.
2263,2265,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.64,COLEVILE,"I am, my lord, but as my betters are"
2264,2266,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.65,COLEVILE,"That led me hither: had they been ruled by me,"
2265,2267,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.66,COLEVILE,You should have won them dearer than you have.
2266,2268,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.67,FALSTAFF,"I know not how they sold themselves: but thou, like"
2267,2269,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.68,FALSTAFF," kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I"
2268,2270,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.69,FALSTAFF,thank thee for thee.
2269,2271,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.70,LANCASTER,"Now, have you left pursuit?"
2270,2272,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.71,WESTMORELAND,Retreat is made and execution stay'd.
2271,2273,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.72,LANCASTER,Send Colevile with his confederates
2272,2274,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.73,LANCASTER,"To York, to present execution:"
2273,2275,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.74,LANCASTER,"Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure."
2274,2276,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.75,LANCASTER,"And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:"
2275,2277,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.76,LANCASTER,I hear the king my father is sore sick:
2276,2278,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.77,LANCASTER,"Our news shall go before us to his majesty,"
2277,2279,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.78,LANCASTER,"Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,"
2278,2280,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.79,LANCASTER,And we with sober speed will follow you.
2279,2281,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.80,FALSTAFF,"My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go"
2280,2282,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.81,FALSTAFF,"Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,"
2281,2283,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.82,FALSTAFF,"Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report."
2282,2284,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.83,LANCASTER,"Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,"
2283,2285,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.84,LANCASTER,Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
2284,2286,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.85,FALSTAFF,I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than
2285,2287,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.86,FALSTAFF,"your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-"
2286,2288,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.87,FALSTAFF,blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make
2287,2289,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.88,FALSTAFF,"him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine."
2288,2290,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.89,FALSTAFF,There's never none of these demure boys come to any
2289,2291,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.90,FALSTAFF,"proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,"
2290,2292,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.91,FALSTAFF,"nd making many fish-meals, that they fall into "
2291,2293,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.92,FALSTAFF,kind of male green-sickness; and then when they
2292,2294,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.93,FALSTAFF,"marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools"
2293,2295,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.94,FALSTAFF,"nd cowards; which some of us should be too, but for"
2294,2296,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.95,FALSTAFF,inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold
2295,2297,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.96,FALSTAFF,operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;
2296,2298,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.97,FALSTAFF,dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
2297,2299,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.98,FALSTAFF,"vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,"
2298,2300,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.99,FALSTAFF,"quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and"
2299,2301,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.100,FALSTAFF,"delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the"
2300,2302,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.101,FALSTAFF,"voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes"
2301,2303,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.102,FALSTAFF,excellent wit. The second property of your
2302,2304,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.103,FALSTAFF,"excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;"
2303,2305,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.104,FALSTAFF,"which, before cold and settled, left the liver"
2304,2306,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.105,FALSTAFF,"white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity"
2305,2307,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.106,FALSTAFF,nd cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes
2306,2308,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.107,FALSTAFF,it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:
2307,2309,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.108,FALSTAFF,"it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives"
2308,2310,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.109,FALSTAFF,"warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,"
2309,2311,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.110,FALSTAFF,"man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and"
2310,2312,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.111,FALSTAFF,"inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,"
2311,2313,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.112,FALSTAFF,"the heart, who, great and puffed up with this"
2312,2314,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.113,FALSTAFF,"retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour"
2313,2315,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.114,FALSTAFF,comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is
2314,2316,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.115,FALSTAFF,"nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and"
2315,2317,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.116,FALSTAFF,"learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till"
2316,2318,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.117,FALSTAFF,sack commences it and sets it in act and use.
2317,2319,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.118,FALSTAFF,Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for
2318,2320,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.119,FALSTAFF,the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
2319,2321,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.120,FALSTAFF,"father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,"
2320,2322,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.121,FALSTAFF,"manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent"
2321,2323,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.122,FALSTAFF,endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
2322,2324,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.123,FALSTAFF,"sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If"
2323,2325,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.124,FALSTAFF,"I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I"
2324,2326,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.125,FALSTAFF,"would teach them should be, to forswear thin"
2325,2327,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.126,FALSTAFF,potations and to addict themselves to sack.
2326,2328,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.127,FALSTAFF,How now Bardolph?
2327,2329,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.128,BARDOLPH,The army is discharged all and gone.
2328,2330,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.129,FALSTAFF,Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and
2329,2331,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.130,FALSTAFF,"there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire:"
2330,2332,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.131,FALSTAFF,I have him already tempering between my finger and
2331,2333,"Henry IV, part two",,4.3.132,FALSTAFF,"my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him. Come away."
2332,2334,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.1,KING HENRY IV,"Now, lords, if God doth give successful end"
2333,2335,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.2,KING HENRY IV,"To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,"
2334,2336,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.3,KING HENRY IV,We will our youth lead on to higher fields
2335,2337,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.4,KING HENRY IV,And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
2336,2338,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.5,KING HENRY IV,"Our navy is address'd, our power collected,"
2337,2339,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.6,KING HENRY IV,"Our substitutes in absence well invested,"
2338,2340,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.7,KING HENRY IV,And every thing lies level to our wish:
2339,2341,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.8,KING HENRY IV,"Only, we want a little personal strength;"
2340,2342,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.9,KING HENRY IV,"And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,"
2341,2343,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.10,KING HENRY IV,Come underneath the yoke of government.
2342,2344,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.11,WARWICK,Both which we doubt not but your majesty
2343,2345,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.12,WARWICK,Shall soon enjoy.
2344,2346,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.13,KING HENRY IV,"Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,"
2345,2347,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.14,KING HENRY IV,Where is the prince your brother?
2346,2348,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.15,GLOUCESTER,"I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor."
2347,2349,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.16,KING HENRY IV,And how accompanied?
2348,2350,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.17,GLOUCESTER,"I do not know, my lord."
2349,2351,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.18,KING HENRY IV,"Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?"
2350,2352,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.19,GLOUCESTER,"No, my good lord; he is in presence here."
2351,2353,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.20,CLARENCE,What would my lord and father?
2352,2354,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.21,KING HENRY IV,"Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence."
2353,2355,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.22,KING HENRY IV,How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?
2354,2356,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.23,KING HENRY IV,"He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;"
2355,2357,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.24,KING HENRY IV,Thou hast a better place in his affection
2356,2358,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.25,KING HENRY IV,"Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,"
2357,2359,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.26,KING HENRY IV,And noble offices thou mayst effect
2358,2360,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.27,KING HENRY IV,"Of mediation, after I am dead,"
2359,2361,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.28,KING HENRY IV,Between his greatness and thy other brethren:
2360,2362,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.29,KING HENRY IV,"Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,"
2361,2363,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.30,KING HENRY IV,Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
2362,2364,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.31,KING HENRY IV,By seeming cold or careless of his will;
2363,2365,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.32,KING HENRY IV,"For he is gracious, if he be observed:"
2364,2366,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.33,KING HENRY IV,He hath a tear for pity and a hand
2365,2367,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.34,KING HENRY IV,Open as day for melting charity:
2366,2368,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.35,KING HENRY IV,"Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,"
2367,2369,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.36,KING HENRY IV,As humorous as winter and as sudden
2368,2370,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.37,KING HENRY IV,As flaws congealed in the spring of day.
2369,2371,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.38,KING HENRY IV,"His temper, therefore, must be well observed:"
2370,2372,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.39,KING HENRY IV,"Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,"
2371,2373,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.40,KING HENRY IV,When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;
2372,2374,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.41,KING HENRY IV,"But, being moody, give him line and scope,"
2373,2375,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.42,KING HENRY IV,"Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,"
2374,2376,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.43,KING HENRY IV,"Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,"
2375,2377,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.44,KING HENRY IV,"And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,"
2376,2378,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.45,KING HENRY IV,"A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,"
2377,2379,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.46,KING HENRY IV,"That the united vessel of their blood,"
2378,2380,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.47,KING HENRY IV,Mingled with venom of suggestion--
2379,2381,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.48,KING HENRY IV,"As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--"
2380,2382,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.49,KING HENRY IV,"Shall never leak, though it do work as strong"
2381,2383,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.50,KING HENRY IV,As aconitum or rash gunpowder.
2382,2384,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.51,CLARENCE,I shall observe him with all care and love.
2383,2385,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.52,KING HENRY IV,"Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?"
2384,2386,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.53,CLARENCE,He is not there to-day; he dines in London.
2385,2387,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.54,KING HENRY IV,And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?
2386,2388,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.55,CLARENCE,"With Poins, and other his continual followers."
2387,2389,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.56,KING HENRY IV,Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;
2388,2390,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.57,KING HENRY IV,"And he, the noble image of my youth,"
2389,2391,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.58,KING HENRY IV,Is overspread with them: therefore my grief
2390,2392,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.59,KING HENRY IV,Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:
2391,2393,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.60,KING HENRY IV,The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
2392,2394,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.61,KING HENRY IV,In forms imaginary the unguided days
2393,2395,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.62,KING HENRY IV,And rotten times that you shall look upon
2394,2396,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.63,KING HENRY IV,When I am sleeping with my ancestors.
2395,2397,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.64,KING HENRY IV,"For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,"
2396,2398,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.65,KING HENRY IV,"When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,"
2397,2399,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.66,KING HENRY IV,"When means and lavish manners meet together,"
2398,2400,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.67,KING HENRY IV,"O, with what wings shall his affections fly"
2399,2401,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.68,KING HENRY IV,Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!
2400,2402,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.69,WARWICK,"My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:"
2401,2403,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.70,WARWICK,The prince but studies his companions
2402,2404,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.71,WARWICK,"Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,"
2403,2405,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.72,WARWICK,Tis needful that the most immodest word
2404,2406,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.73,WARWICK,"Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,"
2405,2407,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.74,WARWICK,"Your highness knows, comes to no further use"
2406,2408,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.75,WARWICK,"But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,"
2407,2409,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.76,WARWICK,The prince will in the perfectness of time
2408,2410,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.77,WARWICK,Cast off his followers; and their memory
2409,2411,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.78,WARWICK,"Shall as a pattern or a measure live,"
2410,2412,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.79,WARWICK,"By which his grace must mete the lives of others,"
2411,2413,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.80,WARWICK,Turning past evils to advantages.
2412,2414,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.81,KING HENRY IV,Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
2413,2415,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.82,KING HENRY IV,In the dead carrion.
2414,2416,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.83,KING HENRY IV,Who's here? Westmoreland?
2415,2417,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.84,WESTMORELAND,"Health to my sovereign, and new happiness"
2416,2418,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.85,WESTMORELAND,Added to that that I am to deliver!
2417,2419,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.86,WESTMORELAND,Prince John your son doth kiss your grace's hand:
2418,2420,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.87,WESTMORELAND,"Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings and all"
2419,2421,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.88,WESTMORELAND,Are brought to the correction of your law;
2420,2422,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.89,WESTMORELAND,There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd
2421,2423,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.90,WESTMORELAND,But peace puts forth her olive every where.
2422,2424,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.91,WESTMORELAND,The manner how this action hath been borne
2423,2425,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.92,WESTMORELAND,"Here at more leisure may your highness read,"
2424,2426,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.93,WESTMORELAND,With every course in his particular.
2425,2427,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.94,KING HENRY IV,"O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,"
2426,2428,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.95,KING HENRY IV,Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
2427,2429,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.96,KING HENRY IV,The lifting up of day.
2428,2430,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.97,KING HENRY IV,"Look, here's more news."
2429,2431,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.98,HARCOURT,From enemies heaven keep your majesty;
2430,2432,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.99,HARCOURT,"And, when they stand against you, may they fall"
2431,2433,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.100,HARCOURT,As those that I am come to tell you of!
2432,2434,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.101,HARCOURT,"The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,"
2433,2435,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.102,HARCOURT,With a great power of English and of Scots
2434,2436,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.103,HARCOURT,Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown:
2435,2437,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.104,HARCOURT,The manner and true order of the fight
2436,2438,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.105,HARCOURT,"This packet, please it you, contains at large."
2437,2439,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.106,KING HENRY IV,And wherefore should these good news make me sick?
2438,2440,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.107,KING HENRY IV,"Will fortune never come with both hands full,"
2439,2441,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.108,KING HENRY IV,But write her fair words still in foulest letters?
2440,2442,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.109,KING HENRY IV,She either gives a stomach and no food;
2441,2443,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.110,KING HENRY IV,"Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast"
2442,2444,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.111,KING HENRY IV,"And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,"
2443,2445,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.112,KING HENRY IV,That have abundance and enjoy it not.
2444,2446,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.113,KING HENRY IV,I should rejoice now at this happy news;
2445,2447,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.114,KING HENRY IV,"And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:"
2446,2448,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.115,KING HENRY IV,O me! come near me; now I am much ill.
2447,2449,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.116,GLOUCESTER,"Comfort, your majesty!"
2448,2450,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.117,CLARENCE,O my royal father!
2449,2451,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.118,WESTMORELAND,"My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up."
2450,2452,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.119,WARWICK,"Be patient, princes; you do know, these fits"
2451,2453,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.120,WARWICK,Are with his highness very ordinary.
2452,2454,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.121,WARWICK,Stand from him. Give him air; he'll straight be well.
2453,2455,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.122,CLARENCE,"No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:"
2454,2456,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.123,CLARENCE,The incessant care and labour of his mind
2455,2457,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.124,CLARENCE,Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
2456,2458,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.125,CLARENCE,So thin that life looks through and will break out.
2457,2459,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.126,GLOUCESTER,The people fear me; for they do observe
2458,2460,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.127,GLOUCESTER,Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:
2459,2461,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.128,GLOUCESTER,"The seasons change their manners, as the year"
2460,2462,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.129,GLOUCESTER,Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.
2461,2463,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.130,CLARENCE,"The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;"
2462,2464,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.131,CLARENCE,"And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,"
2463,2465,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.132,CLARENCE,Say it did so a little time before
2464,2466,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.133,CLARENCE,"That our great-grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died."
2465,2467,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.134,WARWICK,"Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers."
2466,2468,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.135,GLOUCESTER,This apoplexy will certain be his end.
2467,2469,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.136,KING HENRY IV,"I pray you, take me up, and bear me hence"
2468,2470,"Henry IV, part two",,4.4.137,KING HENRY IV,"Into some other chamber: softly, pray."
2469,2471,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.1,KING HENRY IV,"Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;"
2470,2472,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.2,KING HENRY IV,Unless some dull and favourable hand
2471,2473,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.3,KING HENRY IV,Will whisper music to my weary spirit.
2472,2474,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.4,WARWICK,Call for the music in the other room.
2473,2475,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.5,KING HENRY IV,Set me the crown upon my pillow here.
2474,2476,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.6,CLARENCE,"His eye is hollow, and he changes much."
2475,2477,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.7,WARWICK,"Less noise, less noise!"
2476,2478,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.8,PRINCE HENRY,Who saw the Duke of Clarence?
2477,2479,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.9,CLARENCE,"I am here, brother, full of heaviness."
2478,2480,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.10,PRINCE HENRY,"How now! rain within doors, and none abroad!"
2479,2481,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.11,PRINCE HENRY,How doth the king?
2480,2482,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.12,GLOUCESTER,Exceeding ill.
2481,2483,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.13,PRINCE HENRY,Heard he the good news yet?
2482,2484,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.14,PRINCE HENRY,Tell it him.
2483,2485,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.15,GLOUCESTER,He alter'd much upon the hearing it.
2484,2486,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.16,PRINCE HENRY,"If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic."
2485,2487,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.17,WARWICK,"Not so much noise, my lords: sweet prince,"
2486,2488,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.18,WARWICK,speak low;
2487,2489,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.19,WARWICK,The king your father is disposed to sleep.
2488,2490,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.20,CLARENCE,Let us withdraw into the other room.
2489,2491,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.21,WARWICK,Will't please your grace to go along with us?
2490,2492,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.22,PRINCE HENRY,No; I will sit and watch here by the king.
2491,2493,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.23,PRINCE HENRY,"Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,"
2492,2494,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.24,PRINCE HENRY,Being so troublesome a bedfellow?
2493,2495,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.25,PRINCE HENRY,O polish'd perturbation! golden care!
2494,2496,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.26,PRINCE HENRY,That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
2495,2497,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.27,PRINCE HENRY,To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!
2496,2498,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.28,PRINCE HENRY,Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
2497,2499,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.29,PRINCE HENRY,As he whose brow with homely biggen bound
2498,2500,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.30,PRINCE HENRY,Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!
2499,2501,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.31,PRINCE HENRY,"When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit"
2500,2502,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.32,PRINCE HENRY,"Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,"
2501,2503,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.33,PRINCE HENRY,That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath
2502,2504,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.34,PRINCE HENRY,There lies a downy feather which stirs not:
2503,2505,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.35,PRINCE HENRY,"Did he suspire, that light and weightless down"
2504,2506,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.36,PRINCE HENRY,Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!
2505,2507,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.37,PRINCE HENRY,"This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep"
2506,2508,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.38,PRINCE HENRY,That from this golden rigol hath divorced
2507,2509,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.39,PRINCE HENRY,So many English kings. Thy due from me
2508,2510,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.40,PRINCE HENRY,"Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,"
2509,2511,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.41,PRINCE HENRY,"Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,"
2510,2512,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.42,PRINCE HENRY,"Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:"
2511,2513,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.43,PRINCE HENRY,"My due from thee is this imperial crown,"
2512,2514,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.44,PRINCE HENRY,"Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,"
2513,2515,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.45,PRINCE HENRY,"Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,"
2514,2516,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.46,PRINCE HENRY,Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strength
2515,2517,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.47,PRINCE HENRY,"Into one giant arm, it shall not force"
2516,2518,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.48,PRINCE HENRY,This lineal honour from me: this from thee
2517,2519,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.49,PRINCE HENRY,"Will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me."
2518,2520,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.50,KING HENRY IV,Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!
2519,2521,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.51,CLARENCE,Doth the king call?
2520,2522,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.52,WARWICK,What would your majesty? How fares your grace?
2521,2523,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.53,KING HENRY IV,"Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?"
2522,2524,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.54,CLARENCE,"We left the prince my brother here, my liege,"
2523,2525,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.55,CLARENCE,Who undertook to sit and watch by you.
2524,2526,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.56,KING HENRY IV,The Prince of Wales! Where is he? let me see him:
2525,2527,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.57,KING HENRY IV,He is not here.
2526,2528,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.58,WARWICK,This door is open; he is gone this way.
2527,2529,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.59,GLOUCESTER,He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.
2528,2530,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.60,KING HENRY IV,Where is the crown? who took it from my pillow?
2529,2531,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.61,WARWICK,"When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here."
2530,2532,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.62,KING HENRY IV,"The prince hath ta'en it hence: go, seek him out."
2531,2533,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.63,KING HENRY IV,Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
2532,2534,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.64,KING HENRY IV,My sleep my death?
2533,2535,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.65,KING HENRY IV,"Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither."
2534,2536,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.66,KING HENRY IV,"This part of his conjoins with my disease,"
2535,2537,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.67,KING HENRY IV,"And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!"
2536,2538,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.68,KING HENRY IV,How quickly nature falls into revolt
2537,2539,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.69,KING HENRY IV,When gold becomes her object!
2538,2540,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.70,KING HENRY IV,For this the foolish over-careful fathers
2539,2541,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.71,KING HENRY IV,"Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,"
2540,2542,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.72,KING HENRY IV,Their bones with industry;
2541,2543,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.73,KING HENRY IV,For this they have engrossed and piled up
2542,2544,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.74,KING HENRY IV,The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold;
2543,2545,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.75,KING HENRY IV,For this they have been thoughtful to invest
2544,2546,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.76,KING HENRY IV,Their sons with arts and martial exercises:
2545,2547,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.77,KING HENRY IV,"When, like the bee, culling from every flower"
2546,2548,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.78,KING HENRY IV,"The virtuous sweets,"
2547,2549,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.79,KING HENRY IV,"Our thighs pack'd with wax, our mouths with honey,"
2548,2550,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.80,KING HENRY IV,"We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,"
2549,2551,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.81,KING HENRY IV,Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste
2550,2552,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.82,KING HENRY IV,Yield his engrossments to the ending father.
2551,2553,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.83,KING HENRY IV,"Now, where is he that will not stay so long"
2552,2554,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.84,KING HENRY IV,Till his friend sickness hath determined me?
2553,2555,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.85,WARWICK,"My lord, I found the prince in the next room,"
2554,2556,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.86,WARWICK,"Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,"
2555,2557,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.87,WARWICK,With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow
2556,2558,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.88,WARWICK,"That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,"
2557,2559,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.89,WARWICK,"Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife"
2558,2560,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.90,WARWICK,With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.
2559,2561,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.91,KING HENRY IV,But wherefore did he take away the crown?
2560,2562,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.92,KING HENRY IV,"Lo, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry."
2561,2563,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.93,KING HENRY IV,"Depart the chamber, leave us here alone."
2562,2564,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.94,PRINCE HENRY,I never thought to hear you speak again.
2563,2565,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.95,KING HENRY IV,"Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:"
2564,2566,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.96,KING HENRY IV,"I stay too long by thee, I weary thee."
2565,2567,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.97,KING HENRY IV,Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
2566,2568,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.98,KING HENRY IV,That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
2567,2569,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.99,KING HENRY IV,Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!
2568,2570,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.100,KING HENRY IV,Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.
2569,2571,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.101,KING HENRY IV,Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity
2570,2572,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.102,KING HENRY IV,Is held from falling with so weak a wind
2571,2573,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.103,KING HENRY IV,That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.
2572,2574,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.104,KING HENRY IV,Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
2573,2575,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.105,KING HENRY IV,Were thine without offence; and at my death
2574,2576,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.106,KING HENRY IV,Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:
2575,2577,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.107,KING HENRY IV,"Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,"
2576,2578,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.108,KING HENRY IV,And thou wilt have me die assured of it.
2577,2579,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.109,KING HENRY IV,"Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,"
2578,2580,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.110,KING HENRY IV,"Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,"
2579,2581,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.111,KING HENRY IV,To stab at half an hour of my life.
2580,2582,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.112,KING HENRY IV,What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?
2581,2583,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.113,KING HENRY IV,"Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,"
2582,2584,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.114,KING HENRY IV,And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
2583,2585,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.115,KING HENRY IV,"That thou art crowned, not that I am dead."
2584,2586,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.116,KING HENRY IV,Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
2585,2587,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.117,KING HENRY IV,Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:
2586,2588,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.118,KING HENRY IV,Only compound me with forgotten dust
2587,2589,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.119,KING HENRY IV,Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
2588,2590,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.120,KING HENRY IV,"Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;"
2589,2591,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.121,KING HENRY IV,For now a time is come to mock at form:
2590,2592,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.122,KING HENRY IV,"Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!"
2591,2593,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.123,KING HENRY IV,"Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!"
2592,2594,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.124,KING HENRY IV,"And to the English court assemble now,"
2593,2595,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.125,KING HENRY IV,"From every region, apes of idleness!"
2594,2596,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.126,KING HENRY IV,"Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:"
2595,2597,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.127,KING HENRY IV,"Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,"
2596,2598,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.128,KING HENRY IV,"Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit"
2597,2599,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.129,KING HENRY IV,The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
2598,2600,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.130,KING HENRY IV,"Be happy, he will trouble you no more;"
2599,2601,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.131,KING HENRY IV,"England shall double gild his treble guilt,"
2600,2602,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.132,KING HENRY IV,"England shall give him office, honour, might;"
2601,2603,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.133,KING HENRY IV,For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks
2602,2604,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.134,KING HENRY IV,"The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog"
2603,2605,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.135,KING HENRY IV,Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.
2604,2606,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.136,KING HENRY IV,"O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!"
2605,2607,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.137,KING HENRY IV,"When that my care could not withhold thy riots,"
2606,2608,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.138,KING HENRY IV,What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?
2607,2609,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.139,KING HENRY IV,"O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,"
2608,2610,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.140,KING HENRY IV,"Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!"
2609,2611,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.141,PRINCE HENRY,"O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,"
2610,2612,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.142,PRINCE HENRY,"The moist impediments unto my speech,"
2611,2613,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.143,PRINCE HENRY,I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
2612,2614,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.144,PRINCE HENRY,Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
2613,2615,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.145,PRINCE HENRY,The course of it so far. There is your crown;
2614,2616,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.146,PRINCE HENRY,And He that wears the crown immortally
2615,2617,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.147,PRINCE HENRY,Long guard it yours! If I affect it more
2616,2618,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.148,PRINCE HENRY,"Than as your honour and as your renown,"
2617,2619,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.149,PRINCE HENRY,"Let me no more from this obedience rise,"
2618,2620,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.150,PRINCE HENRY,Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
2619,2621,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.151,PRINCE HENRY,"Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending."
2620,2622,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.152,PRINCE HENRY,"God witness with me, when I here came in,"
2621,2623,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.153,PRINCE HENRY,"And found no course of breath within your majesty,"
2622,2624,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.154,PRINCE HENRY,"How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,"
2623,2625,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.155,PRINCE HENRY,"O, let me in my present wildness die"
2624,2626,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.156,PRINCE HENRY,And never live to show the incredulous world
2625,2627,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.157,PRINCE HENRY,The noble change that I have purposed!
2626,2628,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.158,PRINCE HENRY,"Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,"
2627,2629,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.159,PRINCE HENRY,"And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,"
2628,2630,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.160,PRINCE HENRY,"I spake unto this crown as having sense,"
2629,2631,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.161,PRINCE HENRY,And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
2630,2632,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.162,PRINCE HENRY,Hath fed upon the body of my father;
2631,2633,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.163,PRINCE HENRY,"Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:"
2632,2634,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.164,PRINCE HENRY,"Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,"
2633,2635,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.165,PRINCE HENRY,Preserving life in medicine potable;
2634,2636,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.166,PRINCE HENRY,"But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,"
2635,2637,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.167,PRINCE HENRY,"Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,"
2636,2638,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.168,PRINCE HENRY,"Accusing it, I put it on my head,"
2637,2639,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.169,PRINCE HENRY,"To try with it, as with an enemy"
2638,2640,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.170,PRINCE HENRY,"That had before my face murder'd my father,"
2639,2641,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.171,PRINCE HENRY,The quarrel of a true inheritor.
2640,2642,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.172,PRINCE HENRY,"But if it did infect my blood with joy,"
2641,2643,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.173,PRINCE HENRY,Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
2642,2644,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.174,PRINCE HENRY,If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
2643,2645,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.175,PRINCE HENRY,Did with the least affection of a welcome
2644,2646,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.176,PRINCE HENRY,"Give entertainment to the might of it,"
2645,2647,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.177,PRINCE HENRY,Let God for ever keep it from my head
2646,2648,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.178,PRINCE HENRY,And make me as the poorest vassal is
2647,2649,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.179,PRINCE HENRY,That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!
2648,2650,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.180,KING HENRY IV,"O my son,"
2649,2651,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.181,KING HENRY IV,"God put it in thy mind to take it hence,"
2650,2652,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.182,KING HENRY IV,"That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,"
2651,2653,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.183,KING HENRY IV,Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
2652,2654,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.184,KING HENRY IV,"Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;"
2653,2655,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.185,KING HENRY IV,"And hear, I think, the very latest counsel"
2654,2656,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.186,KING HENRY IV,"That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,"
2655,2657,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.187,KING HENRY IV,By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways
2656,2658,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.188,KING HENRY IV,I met this crown; and I myself know well
2657,2659,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.189,KING HENRY IV,How troublesome it sat upon my head.
2658,2660,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.190,KING HENRY IV,"To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,"
2659,2661,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.191,KING HENRY IV,"Better opinion, better confirmation;"
2660,2662,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.192,KING HENRY IV,For all the soil of the achievement goes
2661,2663,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.193,KING HENRY IV,With me into the earth. It seem'd in me
2662,2664,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.194,KING HENRY IV,"But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,"
2663,2665,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.195,KING HENRY IV,And I had many living to upbraid
2664,2666,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.196,KING HENRY IV,My gain of it by their assistances;
2665,2667,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.197,KING HENRY IV,"Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,"
2666,2668,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.198,KING HENRY IV,Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears
2667,2669,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.199,KING HENRY IV,Thou see'st with peril I have answered;
2668,2670,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.200,KING HENRY IV,For all my reign hath been but as a scene
2669,2671,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.201,KING HENRY IV,Acting that argument: and now my death
2670,2672,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.202,KING HENRY IV,"Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,"
2671,2673,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.203,KING HENRY IV,Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
2672,2674,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.204,KING HENRY IV,So thou the garland wear'st successively.
2673,2675,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.205,KING HENRY IV,"Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,"
2674,2676,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.206,KING HENRY IV,"Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;"
2675,2677,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.207,KING HENRY IV,"And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,"
2676,2678,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.208,KING HENRY IV,Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;
2677,2679,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.209,KING HENRY IV,By whose fell working I was first advanced
2678,2680,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.210,KING HENRY IV,And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
2679,2681,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.211,KING HENRY IV,"To be again displaced: which to avoid,"
2680,2682,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.212,KING HENRY IV,I cut them off; and had a purpose now
2681,2683,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.213,KING HENRY IV,"To lead out many to the Holy Land,"
2682,2684,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.214,KING HENRY IV,Lest rest and lying still might make them look
2683,2685,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.215,KING HENRY IV,"Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,"
2684,2686,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.216,KING HENRY IV,Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
2685,2687,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.217,KING HENRY IV,"With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,"
2686,2688,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.218,KING HENRY IV,May waste the memory of the former days.
2687,2689,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.219,KING HENRY IV,"More would I, but my lungs are wasted so"
2688,2690,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.220,KING HENRY IV,That strength of speech is utterly denied me.
2689,2691,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.221,KING HENRY IV,"How I came by the crown, O God forgive;"
2690,2692,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.222,KING HENRY IV,And grant it may with thee in true peace live!
2691,2693,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.223,PRINCE HENRY,"My gracious liege,"
2692,2694,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.224,PRINCE HENRY,"You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;"
2693,2695,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.225,PRINCE HENRY,Then plain and right must my possession be:
2694,2696,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.226,PRINCE HENRY,Which I with more than with a common pain
2695,2697,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.227,PRINCE HENRY,Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.
2696,2698,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.228,KING HENRY IV,"Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster."
2697,2699,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.229,LANCASTER,"Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!"
2698,2700,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.230,KING HENRY IV,"Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;"
2699,2701,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.231,KING HENRY IV,"But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown"
2700,2702,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.232,KING HENRY IV,From this bare wither'd trunk: upon thy sight
2701,2703,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.233,KING HENRY IV,My worldly business makes a period.
2702,2704,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.234,KING HENRY IV,Where is my Lord of Warwick?
2703,2705,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.235,PRINCE HENRY,My Lord of Warwick!
2704,2706,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.236,KING HENRY IV,Doth any name particular belong
2705,2707,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.237,KING HENRY IV,Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
2706,2708,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.238,WARWICK,"Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord."
2707,2709,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.239,KING HENRY IV,Laud be to God! even there my life must end.
2708,2710,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.240,KING HENRY IV,"It hath been prophesied to me many years,"
2709,2711,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.241,KING HENRY IV,I should not die but in Jerusalem;
2710,2712,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.242,KING HENRY IV,Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land:
2711,2713,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.243,KING HENRY IV,But bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie;
2712,2714,"Henry IV, part two",,4.5.244,KING HENRY IV,In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.

2723,2725,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.11,DAVY,"Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served:"
2724,2726,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.12,DAVY,"nd, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat?"
2725,2727,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.13,SHALLOW,"With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook: are"
2726,2728,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.14,SHALLOW,there no young pigeons?
2727,2729,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.15,DAVY,"Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing"

2734,2736,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.22,SHALLOW,"A' shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple"

2738,2740,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.26,SHALLOW,"Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the"
2739,2741,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.27,SHALLOW,court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men
2740,2742,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.28,SHALLOW,"well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite."
2741,2743,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.29,DAVY,"No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they"

2745,2747,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.33,DAVY,Woncot against Clement Perkes of the hill.
2746,2748,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.34,SHALLOW,"There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor:"
2747,2749,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.35,SHALLOW,"that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge."
2748,2750,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.36,DAVY,"I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but"
2749,2751,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.37,DAVY,"yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some"
2750,2752,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.38,DAVY,countenance at his friend's request. An honest
2751,2753,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.39,DAVY,"man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave"
2752,2754,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.40,DAVY,"is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,"
2753,2755,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.41,DAVY,this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in
2754,2756,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.42,DAVY," quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I"
2755,2757,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.43,DAVY,have but a very little credit with your worship. The
2756,2758,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.44,DAVY,"knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I"
2757,2759,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.45,DAVY,"beseech your worship, let him be countenanced."
2758,2760,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.46,SHALLOW,"Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy."
2759,2761,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.47,SHALLOW,"Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off"
2760,2762,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.48,SHALLOW,"with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph."
2761,2763,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.49,BARDOLPH,I am glad to see your worship.
2762,2764,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.50,SHALLOW,"I thank thee with all my heart, kind"
2763,2765,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.51,SHALLOW,"Master Bardolph: and welcome, my tall fellow."
2764,2766,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.52,SHALLOW,"Come, Sir John."
2765,2767,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.53,FALSTAFF,"I'll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow."
2766,2768,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.54,FALSTAFF,"Bardolph, look to our horses."
2767,2769,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.55,FALSTAFF,"If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four"
2768,2770,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.56,FALSTAFF,dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master
2769,2771,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.57,FALSTAFF,Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the
2770,2772,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.58,FALSTAFF,semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:
2771,2773,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.59,FALSTAFF,"they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like"
2772,2774,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.60,FALSTAFF,"foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is"
2773,2775,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.61,FALSTAFF,turned into a justice-like serving-man: their
2774,2776,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.62,FALSTAFF,spirits are so married in conjunction with the
2775,2777,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.63,FALSTAFF,participation of society that they flock together in
2776,2778,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.64,FALSTAFF,"consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit"
2777,2779,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.65,FALSTAFF,"to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the"
2778,2780,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.66,FALSTAFF,imputation of being near their master: if to his
2779,2781,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.67,FALSTAFF,"men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man"
2780,2782,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.68,FALSTAFF,could better command his servants. It is certain
2781,2783,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.69,FALSTAFF,that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
2782,2784,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.70,FALSTAFF,"caught, as men take diseases, one of another:"
2783,2785,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.71,FALSTAFF,therefore let men take heed of their company. I
2784,2786,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.72,FALSTAFF,will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to
2785,2787,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.73,FALSTAFF,keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing
2786,2788,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.74,FALSTAFF,"out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two"
2787,2789,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.75,FALSTAFF,"ctions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,"
2788,2790,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.76,FALSTAFF,it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest
2789,2791,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.77,FALSTAFF,with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
2790,2792,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.78,FALSTAFF,"had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him"
2791,2793,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.79,FALSTAFF,laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!
2792,2794,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.80,SHALLOW,[Within]  Sir John!
2793,2795,"Henry IV, part two",,5.1.81,FALSTAFF,"I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow."
2794,2796,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.1,WARWICK,"How now, my lord chief-justice! whither away?"
2795,2797,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.2,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	How doth the king?
2796,2798,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.3,WARWICK,Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.
2797,2799,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.4,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	I hope, not dead."
2798,2800,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.5,WARWICK,He's walk'd the way of nature;
2799,2801,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.6,WARWICK,And to our purposes he lives no more.
2800,2802,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.7,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	I would his majesty had call'd me with him:
2801,2803,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.8,Lord Chief-Justice,The service that I truly did his life
2802,2804,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.9,Lord Chief-Justice,Hath left me open to all injuries.
2803,2805,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.10,WARWICK,Indeed I think the young king loves you not.
2804,2806,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.11,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	I know he doth not, and do arm myself"
2805,2807,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.12,Lord Chief-Justice,"To welcome the condition of the time,"
2806,2808,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.13,Lord Chief-Justice,Which cannot look more hideously upon me
2807,2809,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.14,Lord Chief-Justice,Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.
2808,2810,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.15,WARWICK,Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry:
2809,2811,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.16,WARWICK,O that the living Harry had the temper
2810,2812,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.17,WARWICK,"Of him, the worst of these three gentlemen!"
2811,2813,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.18,WARWICK,How many nobles then should hold their places
2812,2814,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.19,WARWICK,That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!
2813,2815,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.20,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	O God, I fear all will be overturn'd!"
2814,2816,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.21,LANCASTER,"Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow."
2815,2817,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.22,GLOUCESTER CLARENCE,"Good morrow, cousin."
2816,2818,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.23,LANCASTER,We meet like men that had forgot to speak.
2817,2819,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.24,WARWICK,We do remember; but our argument
2818,2820,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.25,WARWICK,Is all too heavy to admit much talk.
2819,2821,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.26,LANCASTER,"Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy."
2820,2822,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.27,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!"
2821,2823,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.28,GLOUCESTER,"O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;"
2822,2824,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.29,GLOUCESTER,And I dare swear you borrow not that face
2823,2825,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.30,GLOUCESTER,"Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your own."
2824,2826,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.31,LANCASTER,"Though no man be assured what grace to find,"
2825,2827,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.32,LANCASTER,You stand in coldest expectation:
2826,2828,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.33,LANCASTER,I am the sorrier; would 'twere otherwise.
2827,2829,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.34,CLARENCE,"Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;"
2828,2830,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.35,CLARENCE,Which swims against your stream of quality.
2829,2831,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.36,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	Sweet princes, what I did, I did in honour,"
2830,2832,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.37,Lord Chief-Justice,Led by the impartial conduct of my soul:
2831,2833,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.38,Lord Chief-Justice,And never shall you see that I will beg
2832,2834,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.39,Lord Chief-Justice,A ragged and forestall'd remission.
2833,2835,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.40,Lord Chief-Justice,"If truth and upright innocency fail me,"
2834,2836,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.41,Lord Chief-Justice,"I'll to the king my master that is dead,"
2835,2837,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.42,Lord Chief-Justice,And tell him who hath sent me after him.
2836,2838,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.43,WARWICK,Here comes the prince.
2837,2839,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.44,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	Good morrow; and God save your majesty!
2838,2840,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.45,KING HENRY V,"This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,"
2839,2841,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.46,KING HENRY V,Sits not so easy on me as you think.
2840,2842,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.47,KING HENRY V,"Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:"
2841,2843,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.48,KING HENRY V,"This is the English, not the Turkish court;"
2842,2844,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.49,KING HENRY V,"Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,"
2843,2845,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.50,KING HENRY V,"But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,"
2844,2846,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.51,KING HENRY V,"For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:"
2845,2847,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.52,KING HENRY V,Sorrow so royally in you appears
2846,2848,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.53,KING HENRY V,That I will deeply put the fashion on
2847,2849,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.54,KING HENRY V,"And wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;"
2848,2850,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.55,KING HENRY V,"But entertain no more of it, good brothers,"
2849,2851,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.56,KING HENRY V,Than a joint burden laid upon us all.
2850,2852,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.57,KING HENRY V,"For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,"
2851,2853,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.58,KING HENRY V,I'll be your father and your brother too;
2852,2854,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.59,KING HENRY V,"Let me but bear your love, I 'll bear your cares:"
2853,2855,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.60,KING HENRY V,Yet weep that Harry's dead; and so will I;
2854,2856,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.61,KING HENRY V,"But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears"
2855,2857,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.62,KING HENRY V,By number into hours of happiness.
2856,2858,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.63,Princes,We hope no other from your majesty.
2857,2859,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.64,KING HENRY V,You all look strangely on me: and you most;
2858,2860,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.65,KING HENRY V,"You are, I think, assured I love you not."
2859,2861,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.66,Lord Chief-Justice,"Lord Chief-Justice	I am assured, if I be measured rightly,"
2860,2862,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.67,Lord Chief-Justice,Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.
2861,2863,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.68,KING HENRY V,No!
2862,2864,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.69,KING HENRY V,How might a prince of my great hopes forget
2863,2865,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.70,KING HENRY V,So great indignities you laid upon me?
2864,2866,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.71,KING HENRY V,"What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison"
2865,2867,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.72,KING HENRY V,The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?
2866,2868,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.73,KING HENRY V,"May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?"
2867,2869,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.74,Lord Chief-Justice,Lord Chief-Justice	I then did use the person of your father;
2868,2870,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.75,Lord Chief-Justice,The image of his power lay then in me:
2869,2871,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.76,Lord Chief-Justice,"And, in the administration of his law,"
2870,2872,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.77,Lord Chief-Justice,"Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,"
2871,2873,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.78,Lord Chief-Justice,"Your highness pleased to forget my place,"
2872,2874,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.79,Lord Chief-Justice,"The majesty and power of law and justice,"
2873,2875,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.80,Lord Chief-Justice,"The image of the king whom I presented,"
2874,2876,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.81,Lord Chief-Justice,And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
2875,2877,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.82,Lord Chief-Justice,"Whereon, as an offender to your father,"
2876,2878,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.83,Lord Chief-Justice,I gave bold way to my authority
2877,2879,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.84,Lord Chief-Justice,"And did commit you. If the deed were ill,"
2878,2880,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.85,Lord Chief-Justice,"Be you contented, wearing now the garland,"
2879,2881,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.86,Lord Chief-Justice,"To have a son set your decrees at nought,"
2880,2882,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.87,Lord Chief-Justice,"To pluck down justice from your awful bench,"
2881,2883,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.88,Lord Chief-Justice,To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
2882,2884,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.89,Lord Chief-Justice,That guards the peace and safety of your person;
2883,2885,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.90,Lord Chief-Justice,"Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image"
2884,2886,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.91,Lord Chief-Justice,And mock your workings in a second body.
2885,2887,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.92,Lord Chief-Justice,"Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;"
2886,2888,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.93,Lord Chief-Justice,"Be now the father and propose a son,"
2887,2889,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.94,Lord Chief-Justice,"Hear your own dignity so much profaned,"
2888,2890,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.95,Lord Chief-Justice,"See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,"
2889,2891,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.96,Lord Chief-Justice,Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;
2890,2892,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.97,Lord Chief-Justice,And then imagine me taking your part
2891,2893,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.98,Lord Chief-Justice,And in your power soft silencing your son:
2892,2894,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.99,Lord Chief-Justice,"After this cold considerance, sentence me;"
2893,2895,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.100,Lord Chief-Justice,"And, as you are a king, speak in your state"
2894,2896,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.101,Lord Chief-Justice,"What I have done that misbecame my place,"
2895,2897,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.102,Lord Chief-Justice,"My person, or my liege's sovereignty."
2896,2898,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.103,KING HENRY V,"You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;"
2897,2899,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.104,KING HENRY V,Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:
2898,2900,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.105,KING HENRY V,"And I do wish your honours may increase,"
2899,2901,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.106,KING HENRY V,Till you do live to see a son of mine
2900,2902,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.107,KING HENRY V,"Offend you and obey you, as I did."
2901,2903,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.108,KING HENRY V,So shall I live to speak my father's words:
2902,2904,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.109,KING HENRY V,"Happy am I, that have a man so bold,"
2903,2905,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.110,KING HENRY V,That dares do justice on my proper son;
2904,2906,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.111,KING HENRY V,"And not less happy, having such a son,"
2905,2907,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.112,KING HENRY V,That would deliver up his greatness so
2906,2908,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.113,KING HENRY V,Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:
2907,2909,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.114,KING HENRY V,"For which, I do commit into your hand"
2908,2910,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.115,KING HENRY V,The unstained sword that you have used to bear;
2909,2911,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.116,KING HENRY V,"With this remembrance, that you use the same"
2910,2912,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.117,KING HENRY V,"With the like bold, just and impartial spirit"
2911,2913,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.118,KING HENRY V,As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.
2912,2914,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.119,KING HENRY V,You shall be as a father to my youth:
2913,2915,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.120,KING HENRY V,"My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,"
2914,2916,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.121,KING HENRY V,And I will stoop and humble my intents
2915,2917,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.122,KING HENRY V,To your well-practised wise directions.
2916,2918,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.123,KING HENRY V,"And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;"
2917,2919,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.124,KING HENRY V,"My father is gone wild into his grave,"
2918,2920,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.125,KING HENRY V,For in his tomb lie my affections;
2919,2921,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.126,KING HENRY V,"And with his spirit sadly I survive,"
2920,2922,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.127,KING HENRY V,"To mock the expectation of the world,"
2921,2923,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.128,KING HENRY V,To frustrate prophecies and to raze out
2922,2924,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.129,KING HENRY V,"Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down"
2923,2925,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.130,KING HENRY V,After my seeming. The tide of blood in me
2924,2926,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.131,KING HENRY V,Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:
2925,2927,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.132,KING HENRY V,"Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,"
2926,2928,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.133,KING HENRY V,Where it shall mingle with the state of floods
2927,2929,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.134,KING HENRY V,And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
2928,2930,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.135,KING HENRY V,Now call we our high court of parliament:
2929,2931,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.136,KING HENRY V,"And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,"
2930,2932,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.137,KING HENRY V,That the great body of our state may go
2931,2933,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.138,KING HENRY V,In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;
2932,2934,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.139,KING HENRY V,"That war, or peace, or both at once, may be"
2933,2935,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.140,KING HENRY V,As things acquainted and familiar to us;
2934,2936,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.141,KING HENRY V,"In which you, father, shall have foremost hand."
2935,2937,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.142,KING HENRY V,"Our coronation done, we will accite,"
2936,2938,"Henry IV, part two",,5.2.143,KING HENRY V,"As I before remember'd, all our state:"

3180,3182,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.77,FALSTAFF,grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to
3181,3183,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.78,FALSTAFF,"him: look you, he must seem thus to the world:"

3185,3187,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.82,SHALLOW,me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I

3211,3213,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.108,LANCASTER,"Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king."
3212,3214,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.109,LANCASTER,"Come, will you hence?"

3215,3217,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.112,LANCASTER,"My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;"
3216,3218,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.113,LANCASTER,"nd my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look"
3217,3219,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.114,LANCASTER,"for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have"
3218,3220,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.115,LANCASTER,to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I
3219,3221,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.116,LANCASTER,"should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring."
3220,3222,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.117,LANCASTER,"But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it"
3221,3223,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.118,LANCASTER,"known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here"
3222,3224,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.119,LANCASTER,"in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your"
3223,3225,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.120,LANCASTER,patience for it and to promise you a better. I
3224,3226,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.121,LANCASTER,"meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an"

3226,3228,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.123,LANCASTER,"you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you"
3227,3229,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.124,LANCASTER,I would be and here I commit my body to your

3229,3231,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.126,LANCASTER,"s most debtors do, promise you infinitely."
3230,3232,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.127,LANCASTER,"If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will"
3231,3233,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.128,LANCASTER,you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but
3232,3234,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.129,LANCASTER,"light payment, to dance out of your debt. But "
3233,3235,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.130,LANCASTER,"good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,"
3234,3236,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.131,LANCASTER,nd so would I. All the gentlewomen here have
3235,3237,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.132,LANCASTER,"forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the"
3236,3238,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.133,LANCASTER,"gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which"
3237,3239,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.134,LANCASTER,was never seen before in such an assembly.
3238,3240,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.135,LANCASTER,"One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too"
3239,3241,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.136,LANCASTER,"much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will"
3240,3242,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.137,LANCASTER,"continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make"
3241,3243,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.138,LANCASTER,"you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for"
3242,3244,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.139,LANCASTER,"ny thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,"

3245,3247,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.142,LANCASTER,not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are
3246,3248,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.143,LANCASTER,"too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down"
3247,3249,"Henry IV, part two",,5.5.144,LANCASTER,"before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen."
